This addition aims to protect the enzymes from denaturing effects by forming protection between the protein and the reaction medium. Thus, the aim of the work was to evaluate the effect of the use of the PEG additive in the process of immobilization of the commercial lipase of Candida antarctica B (CALB) in xerogel and aerogel obtained by the sol-gel technique. The mathematical model for the process was validated, and the optimum points determined were 0.09 g/ml of enzyme and 0.15 g/ml of polyethylene glycol additive for the xerogel and 0.12 g/ml of enzyme and 0.20 g/mL of polyethylene glycol additive for the aerogel. The maximum esterification activity and yield values were 544 U/g, 585%, and 266 U/g, 140% for xerogel and aerogel, respectively. Polyethylene glycol showed better performance in the esterification activity and stability as an additive when used in the xerogel, that is, when the process of obtaining the support uses the removal of the solvent only by evaporation. Regarding aerogel, a reduction in enzyme activity was observed, which may be due to the interaction of PEG with CO2 in the drying process."

Four studies investigated the reliabilities and different types of validities for a scale developed to measure Iranian Implicit leadership Theories (IILTs). Study 1 used a qualitative method to extract the implicit theories of ideal leadership after interviewing 27 experts. The IILTs are represented by a first-order eight-factor model (Inspiring, Supportive, Accountable, Emotionally Mature, Decisive, Self-protective, Deceptive and Narrow-minded), and a second-order two-factor model (Prototypes and Anti-prototypes). In Study 2, exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the factor structure and further refine and examine the internal consistencies of the discovered factors. The analysis proved the factor structure of IILTs. Study 3 tested the convergent and discriminant validities of the developed scale for IILTs, and the results supported the validity of the developed scale. Study 4 investigated incremental and criterion validities via using two variables of LMX and job satisfaction. These studies provide convergent evidence that IILTs is a valid scale to be used in research. Ultimately, future research venues and practical implications are discussed."

"WOS:000593041000002"	""	""	"With this article, I would like to reflect on the role Fellini played in transforming the urban imagery of his hometown, Rimini, into something new. The idea that Fellini represents an ideal, the incarnation of a national character capable of representing twentieth-century Italy is already well known, even if not sufficiently studied. He is a director who becomes an icon of a way of being, of seeing, of imagining, which are internationally associated with a presumed national identity. The geocultural poles of this identity are Rimini, Rome and Cinecitta, and they express some antinomies rich with personal choices, of multiple belonging and full of psychological implications. The artist expresses a titanic mediation between the persistence of an ancient country and metropolitan evasions, in a negotiating process of anthropological and aesthetic tensions. In this article, I intend to analyse different moments of media expansion directly created by Fellini or born around Fellini. I will therefore try to redefine the reputation and the new public image of the native 'borgo' of the Italian Maestro."

The proposed cycle was used as a sustainable energy curriculum to provide a small hybrid power plant with high energy efficiency. To generate electricity with the system mentioned above, and externally repaired fusion carbon fuel cell was used located at the top of the combined cycle. Moreover, the turbine and steam turbine systems are considered as complementary and bottom layers for co-generation, respectively. The results showed that the proposed system could reach net energy of up to 1125 kilowatts, while the total exergy efficiency (including electricity and heat) for this system is more than 68%. Moreover, the energy supplied and exergy efficiency derived from the proposed cycle are stable versus changes in ambient temperatures. Besides, the effect of increasing the current density on the cell voltage and the total exergy destruction was considered. Also, the new approaches of the exergoeconomics and exergoenvironmental analysis are implemented in this system.

While the discussions that followed the crisis explored at length how the clash and the ensued crisis generated security threats, it seems to have inadequately captured the nuances of the insecurity generated.

Multicultural education is going to be associated with social justice. It refers refers not only to a critical interrogation of power and privilege, but also to acts that intentionally disrupt or respond to systemic oppression towards no-hegemonic groups. A very clarifying example of implementation in the classroom is included in this paper. This proposal encourages a new kind of teacher that gives a great value to dialogue and students' participation; offers them opportunities to commit to fighting against discrimination; to linking ethical values with political actions; and to applying ideas of justice, autonomy, and reciprocity. This work concludes emphasizing the need to develop this methodology in education aimed at a social transformation supported by values such as active respect, freedom, equity, and social justice. To summarize education requires a perspective that recognizes human diversity as normal. This is very important, bearing in mind the drastic increase of economic, social, and cultural inequality that tends to provoke feelings of humiliation and disrespect in disadvantaged groups. It is a situation that hinders a peaceful democratic coexistence."

Entering a strong password on a mobile device requires a person to navigate through multiple keyboard depths to access each character, while entering the same password on a desktop keyboard only requires a user to press keys that are accessible on a single layer. This paper investigates whether the extra physical and cognitive effort associated with using multiple levels of onscreen keyboards changes users' perceptions of password strength. Sixty participants judged perceived security by typing 36 passwords with a differing number of keyboard level transitions on either a mobile device or a desktop keyboard. Analysis revealed that passwords requiring a user to transition between keyboards increased perceptions of security. Passwords that required the use of the shift key on a desktop keyboard returned similar results. This suggests that users may overestimate the security of passwords based on the number of entry keystrokes."

The method converts the formation control problem into an optimization problem, which is solved among the agents in a distributed fashion. The proposed control strategy is one type of Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) which allows the system to cope with disturbances and dynamic environments. A modified Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is designed to solve the trajectory optimization problem and achieve formation scaling. Furthermore, a mechanism is designed to implement path homotopy in splitting and merging of the formation, which examines the H-signature of the generated trajectories. Simulation shows that, by using the proposed method, the formation is able to automatically resize and dynamically split to better avoid obstacles, even in the case of losing communication among agents. Upon splitting the newly formed groups proceed and merge again when it becomes possible."

Lately, the anti-diabetic activity of Puerarin has been documented, but the mechanism of actions has not been elucidated. This study designed to assess the molecular relations obtainable between Puerarin, a compound isolated from Pueraria lobata and targeted receptors linked to Type 2 diabetes mellitus. These processes include the molecular modeling of Puerarin to 5 receptors: peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor - gamma (PPAR gamma), 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11-beta HSD1), glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase sirtuin-6 (SIRT6). Following the outcomes of docking of Puerarin with the five different receptor proteins, revealed that Puerarin is a potent inhibitor which binds well with the different receptors relevant to type-2 diabetes. The pharmacophore features also revealed hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bond acceptors, and hydrogen bond donors. Hence, the results provided insights into the development of better Puerarin as a replacement to present diabetic management."

According to the results of tests like the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the National Plan for Learning Assessment (PLANEA), students in Mexico have a poor command in this type of reasoning, since they know the concepts but they do not know how to apply them. To help in solving this problem, this research presents the assessment of a serious game (which contains multiple-choice problems) to strengthen the logical-mathematical reasoning with the implementation of a system based on fuzzy logic. To achieve the above, two exams which were similar in ability level and time limit were designed and maximum time to answer. Afterward, the first test was applied and then the 33 high-school students were provided with the game, which they used for two weeks and finally the second test was applied. The results from the tests were analyzed based on the duration and the levels reached during the use of the game, it was discovered that most of the students can do linear procedures, but they find it difficult to do multiple procedures. Also, it was identified that those students that used the game or moved to the next level improved their performance, unlike those who did not use it."

However the inorganic materials currently used in microelectronics are barely accepted by neural cells and tissues, thus limiting both the sensor lifetime and efficiency. In particular, penetrating intracortical probes face high failure rate because of a wide immune response of cells and tissues. This adverse reaction called gliosis leads to the rejection of the implanted probe after few weeks and prevent long-lasting recordings of cortical neurons. Such acceptance issue impedes the realization of many neuro-rehabilitation projects. To overcome this, graphene and related carbon-based materials have attracted a lot of interest regarding their positive impact on the adhesion and regeneration of neurons, and their ability to provide high-sensitive electronic devices, such as graphene field effect transistor (G-FET). Such devices can also be implemented on numerous suitable substrates including soft substrates to match the mechanical compliance of cells and tissues, improving further the biocompatibility of the implants. Thus, using graphene as a coating and sensing device material could significantly enhance the acceptance of intracortical probes. However, such a thin monolayer of carbon atoms could be teared off during manipulation and insertion within the brain, and could also display degradation over time. In this work, we have investigated the ability to protect graphene with a natural, biocompatible and degradable polymeric film derivated from hyaluronic acid (HA). We demonstrate that HA-based coatings can be deposited over a wide range of substrates, including intracortical probes and graphene FET arrays without altering the underlying device material, its biocompatibility and sensitivity. Moreover, we show that this coating can be monitored in situ by quantifying the number of deposited charges with the G-FET arrays. The reported graphene functionalization offers promising alternatives for improving the acceptance of various neural interfaces."

The influence of cementation on the mechanical and shear characteristics of CFC with different cement contents was examined through a set of laboratory investigations. The load-settlement behavior of CFC has been investigated through a series of small-scale laboratory plate load tests. Experimental results indicate a substantial impact of cementation and curing periods on the geotechnical characteristics and load-bearing behavior of the CFC. In the second phase of the study, a probabilistic investigation is presented to quantify the influence of uncertainty arising due to improper mixing and compaction of CFC on the bearing behavior of the same. For this, the nonlinear finite element model has been developed and duly validated with the experimental results. The relative influence of different input parameters on the bearing behavior of CFC has been investigated, adopting an efficient factorial design approach. An explicit functional relationship between the significant parameters and bearing behavior of CFC has been developed by multiple regression analysis. The Monte Carlo simulation technique was then employed to assess the influence of the variability of various significant random parameters on the probability of failure of footing on CFC."

Local inflammation or systemic inflammation can trigger zonulin expression. While the increased zonulin level causes an increase of intestinal permeability and entrance of foreign antigens, the latter can increase insulin resistance and inflammation. Polycystic ovarian syndrome affects women during their reproductive age characterized by hyperinsulinemia and/or hyperandrogenemia and associated with infertility problems. Changes in gut permeability such as irritable bowel syndrome are often found in PCOS patients. While metformin increases insulin mediates glucose uptake and, acts as an insulin-sensitizing drug used to treat PCOS patients is recently discovered to reshape intestinal bacteria and hence may affect intestinal action. This study was designed to find any association between zonulin level and other parameters in PCOS patients and to find metformin treatment effects on zonulin in PCOS patients. Thirty-one newly diagnosed PCOS women agree to take metformin 850 mg twice daily for three months and, and to give fasting serum samples to measure zonulin, FSH, LH, total testosterone, free testosterone, SHBG, fasting insulin, and fasting serum glucose before and after treatment. The free testosterone and zonulin are determined by the ELISA technique while the other parameters are determined by the Cobas technique. According to patients' Homeostatic Model Assessment (HOMA-IR), the Patients were divided into two sub-groups: the first group consisting of those with initial HOMA-IR less than two and the second group was those of an initial HOMA-IR of between two to four. Whereas the first group showed no significant response to treatment, the second group showed a better response to metformin treatment, as demonstrated by their LH, total testosterone, free testosterone, fasting insulin, zonulin, and glucose levels. These parameters markedly improved after metformin treatment with p-values of 0.08, 0.09, 0.07. 0.04, 0.01 and 0.06, respectively. (c) 2021 by the authors.

The SWOT matrix was used as a synthesis method to identify the possibilities for the use of citizen science in ethnoecological studies. By using citizen science, it was possible to extend the area of distribution of this new species from the three existing records of individuals captured for the state of Pernambuco and Bahia to eleven records for more than seven states. The citizen science tool was considered useful for the generation of data that complement scientific research, and its greatest obstacle for use in ethnobiological studies was the need to motivate volunteers to increase the robustness of the collected data."

In the content phase, a flat content structure with fielded content types has been defined to make the website content-rich and intuitive to navigate. In the design phase, reusable page templates and engaging UI components were proposed to improve website appearance, usability, and responsiveness. In the development phase, the development framework, technology stack, and development steps to build non-interactive websites have been suggested. Best practices to test, secure, and monitor the website before launching it were also covered in the launch phase. Hosting a website in-house requires addressing issues like quality assurance and system administration in the maintenance phase.

In the specific case of the Pan American Zone of the State of Merida, there are about ten pond ystems in operation, which are studied in this work to observe and analyze its hydrodynamic performance. Using a Model based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (MIKE 21), flow conditions are simulated, respecting input and output configurations, in the representative pond systems of Cano Seco and Cano Amarillo. Depending on the results obtained, it is evident in both ponds that the entry conditions are the same and, therefore, the hydrodynamics is very similar. The output conditions are different and it is clear that the output condition of Cano Amarillo generates more appropriate hydrodynamic patterns, in terms of flow direction and speeds. The current direction pattern, for the configuration of the Cano Seco pons, corresponds to a flow dynamic that facilitates mixing, observing recirculation zones and convergent flows. The observed pattern for Cano Amarillo has less presence of areas of convergent flows and recirculation; therefore, the flow direction pattern, in this case, is less like a mixing dynamic. It is recommended to carry out a Hydrodynamic Study aimed at making modifications in the input and output conditions of the prototypes studied, to improve their hydrodynamics."

Using the unicycle agent model and a standard cascade control structure, it is shown that the stability margins of the cascaded systems deteriorate as the numbers of agents increase. This trend indicates problems with both convergence and scalability. It is then shown that the asymptotic behaviors of the nominal gradient-based control laws can be recovered by introducing a bump function that allows forward motion only when the agents are oriented in appropriate directions. The proposed solution ensures almost global convergence and can be applied to formation systems of all sizes. Finally, comprehensive simulation results show that the usage of a bump function also reduces the total energy consumption required to reach a target formation."

Since faults are assumed to be hidden, periodic inspections and repairs have to be performed in order to detect and remove them. Otherwise, leaving the faulty system unmaintained would eventually lead to a very costly damage. It is also assumed that the time to occurrence of a fault is exponentially distributed and hazardous events constitute a Poisson process. The fault rate, the intensity of the Poisson process and the probability with which a hazardous event results in the system damage are the known parameters. The author presents two main results achieved by analyzing this maintenance model. First, the criteria to be fulfilled by the system parameters in order that preventive maintenance be cost-effective are given in the form of simple inequalities. These criteria must be met so that operating the system with preventive maintenance in place be less costly than operating it until a damage occurs and replacing it thereafter. Second, fairly simple equations are obtained from which the optimal time between inspections can be found numerically by the Newton-Raphson method. The analytical derivation of both the criteria and the equations is presented in detail and is the author's original work. To the best of his knowledge the obtained results are new in the area of maintenance modeling and analysis. For better understanding, theoretical considerations are illustrated by an example of a generic explosion prevention system."

It is considered as an important public health issue and prevalence of, as well as demand for diagnosis, has increased as awareness of the disease grew over the past years. Supply of specialist medical experts has not kept pace with the increasing demand for assessment, both due to financial pressures on health systems and the difficulty to train new experts, resulting in growing waiting lists. Patients are not being treated quickly enough causing problems in other areas of health systems (e.g. increased GP visits, increased risk of self-harm and accidents) and more broadly (e.g. time off work, relationship problems). Advances in AI make it possible to support the clinical diagnosis of ADHD based on the analysis of relevant data. This paper reports on findings related to the mental health services of a specialist Trust within the UK's National Health Service (NHS). The analysis studied data of adult patients who underwent diagnosis over the past few years, and developed a hybrid approach, consisting of two different models: a machine learning model obtained by training on data of past cases; and a knowledge model capturing the expertise of medical experts through knowledge engineering. The resulting algorithm has an accuracy of 95% on data currently available, and is currently being tested in a clinical environment."

The declining communicative abilities of older adults with Alzheimer's disease, however, may affect the quality of life of both caregivers and older adults. This study aimed to explore and better understand the lived experiences of family caregivers in communicating with older adults with this disease. An interpretative phenomenological approach was conducted in the province of Songkhla, Thailand between November 2018 to June 2019. Ten family caregivers were selected by purposeful sampling. Open-ended, semi-structured interviews were conducted. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. Two main themes were identified that represented areas of communication: engaging in troublesome communication; and inability to relate to each other. Effective communication strategies and techniques to improve communication problems were identified such as showing respect, compliance, distraction and therapeutic lies. After understanding the findings of this study, nurse practitioners and nurses need to understand the importance of assessing and analyzing the communication issues between caregivers and their older relatives. Our findings can be a basis for planning and developing appropriate supports to enhance communication skill of the family caregivers within the context of daily communication with older adults with Alzheimer's disease."

It has spread rapidly all around the World and has been accepted as a pandemic. Specific therapies for COVID-19 treatment is not available for now. Thus, there is a huge effort to develop and discover new therapeutic agents and vaccines by scientists. The design and development of new therapeutic agents for treatment through medicinal chemistry is slow and needed a hard labor process. Thus, it is urgent to achieve the discovery of more effective agents. Marine natural products have antiviral activity and quite significant pharmacological capacity. The antiviral properties of these products are shown as new promising therapeutic alternatives against the viruses. The present work aimed to assess the inhibition potential of Didemnin A, B, and C isolated from tunicates to COVID-19 Mpro protein through a molecular docking method. The molecular characterization of compounds with binding affinity was performed by using the Swiss Target Prediction Method. As a result, the binding energy of Didemnins A, B, and C was calculated as -11.82 kcal/ mol, -10.27 kcal/ mol, and -9.26 kcal/ mol, respectively. Also, the docking studies showed that Didemnin B involved in hydrogen bonding with Glu166 in the active site of the Mpro protein. Therefore, the natural marine compounds have the potential for developing drugs against to SARS-CoV-2 virus, which may aid in overcoming the clinical challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic."

"WOS:000583881400026"	"Yes"	"gold_doaj"	"To improve system performance, redundancy is widely used in different kinds of industrial applications such as power systems, aerospace, electronic, telecommunications and manufacturing systems. Designing high performant systems which meet customer requirements with a minimum cost is a challenging task in these industries. This paper develops an efficient approach for the redundancy optimization problem of series-parallel structures modeled as multi-state systems. To reach the target system availability, redundancies are used for components among a list of products available in the market. Each component is characterized by its own availability, cost and performance. The goal is to minimize the total cost under a system availability constraint. Discrete levels of performance are considered for the system and its components. The extreme values of such performance levels correspond to perfect functioning and complete failure. A piecewise cumulative load curve represents consumer demand. System availability corresponds to the aptitude to fulfill this demand. The multi-state system availability evaluation uses the universal moment generating function technique. The proposed optimization algorithm is based on the non-linear threshold accepting metaheuristic, while using a selfadjusting penalty guided strategy. The obtained results demonstrate the approach efficiency for solving the redundancy optimization problem of multi-state systems. Its effectiveness is also tested using the classical redundancy optimization problem of binary-state systems. The algorithm is evaluated by comparison to the best known methods.

Thereby, to achieve greater benefit from these systems, the applications must include fault tolerance mechanisms to satisfy the required reliability. This manuscript focuses on grid computing platform that exposes to two types of threats: crash and silent data corruption faults, which cause the application's failure. This manuscript also addresses the problem of modeling resource availability and aims to minimize the overhead of checkpoint/recovery-fault tolerance techniques. Modeling resources faults has commonly been addressed with exponential distribution, but that isn't fully realistic for the transient errors, which appear randomly. In the manuscript, the authors use Weibull distribution to express these random faults to create the optimal time to save checkpoints."

It is shown that rolling alloy 2017 in helical rolls leads to an increase in the density of dislocations.

The novelty of the approach lies in the introduction of distributed restarting mechanisms that coordinate the evolution of accelerated optimization dynamics with individual asynchronous and periodic time-varying momentum coefficients. We model the algorithms as set-valued hybrid dynamical systems since the method combines continuous-time dynamics with acceleration and set-valued discrete-time restarting updates. For these dynamics, we derive graph-dependent restarting conditions that guarantee suitable stability, robustness, and convergence properties in distributed optimization problems characterized by strongly convex primal functions.

The nonlinearities under consideration are assumed to satisfy local Lipschitz conditions. The observer uses sampled measurements of the system output. A time-varying Lyapunov function is used to give sufficient conditions for the existence of the impulsive observer-based control. The observer and controller gain can be obtained through feasible solutions of the LMIs proposed. The scheme presented here demonstrates that mathematically and through simulation, the proposed approach properly estimates and stabilizes all states."

The aim of this paper is to extend the utility of this model to the reliability analysis of a homogeneous binary-imaged multi-state coherent threshold system of (m + 1) states, which is a non-repairable system with independent non-identical components. The paper characterizes such a system via switching-algebraic expressions of either system success or system failure at each non-zero level. These expressions are given either (a) as minimal sum-of-products formulas, or (b) as probability-ready expressions, which can be immediately converted, on a one-to-one basis, into probabilities or expected values. The various algebraic characterizations can be supplemented by a multitude of map representations, including a single multi-value Karnaugh map (MVKM) (giving a superfluous representation of the system structure function S), (m + 1) maps of binary entries and multi-valued inputs representing the binary instances of S, or m maps, again of binary entries and multi-valued inputs, but now representing the success/failure at every non-zero level of the system. We demonstrate how to reduce these latter maps to conventional Karnaugh maps (CKMs) of much smaller sizes. Various characterizations are inter-related, and also related to pertinent concepts such as shellability of threshold systems, and also to characterizations via minimal upper vectors or via maximal lower vectors."

In machine learning and robotics, two common approaches to promote robustness are adversarial training and domain randomization. Both of these approaches have analogs in control theory: adversarial training relates to H-infinity control and dynamic game theory, while domain randomization relates to theory for systems with stochastic model parameters. We propose a stochastic dynamic game framework that integrates both of these complementary approaches to modeling uncertainty and promoting robustness. We describe policy iteration algorithms in both model-based and model-free settings to compute equilibrium strategies and value functions. We present numerical experiments that illustrate their effectiveness and the value of combining uncertainty representations in our integrated framework.

The thermogravimetric analysis confirmed the formation of inclusion complexes of cyclic oligosaccharide with dairy peptides. The Ames test demonstrated comparable induced mutation rates for samples of hydrolysates and clathrates. Antimutagenic activity of the samples reached 23.928.3 % when tested on strain Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and 19.421.8 % on strain TA 100. According to the impedimetric method, the antibacterial potential of extensive colostrum hydrolysate exceeded the action of cleaved whey against Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538. Enhanced antibacterial activity was found for whey and colostrum peptide fractions included in clathrates with a cyclic oligosaccharide.

To this end, we first study the space of all finite labelled graphs and their limiting objects, and establish analogues of left-convergence, homomorphism densities, a Counting Lemma, and a large family of topologically equivalent metrics on labelled graph space.

For this purpose, 145 water samples were collected and analyzed for the determination of major ions and isotopes (O-18, H-2 and H-3). The isotope analysis of hydrogen, oxygen and tritium allowed a certain distinction between the origin and the mixture of water. The study area is located in the fault corridor of the South Atlas, a network of migration and folding defects that leads to a complex structure characterized by the subdivision of the formations and the variety of facies. The regional flow pattern is mainly influenced by the topography, and this is through the distribution of supply and flow, which is produced by transport at many depths and levels of distribution (local or regional). The rocky nature and the severe fractures are responsible for the division of the hydrogeological units and play an important role in the dynamics and transport of the groundwater. The hydrodynamic analysis shows the dominance of regional hydrogeology in terms of geological nature and structure. This is supported by a hydrochemical signal showing the distribution and evolution of the elements according to the structural and geological scheme (evolution from calcium bicarbonate facies to calcium sulphate medium facies)."

Our proofs use innovative trajectory based contractivity and cooperative systems arguments. Another key ingredient is a new variant of Halanay's inequality, which differs from prior Halanay inequalities because of its use of sampling. Our sufficient conditions allow arbitrarily long intervals between some consecutive sampling times, provided the intervals between consecutive sampling times are frequently small enough. This removes a significant limitation of prior results that relied on versions of Halanay's inequality that did not contain sampling. Unlike standard stability conditions, the upper bounds for the norm of the current state in our less restrictive exponential input-to-state stability conclusions have suprema of disturbances over intervals that include earlier times than the initial times. We apply this letter to a broad class of time-varying continuous time systems with sampling."

Today, within the era of functional genomics the highest goal is to transfer this huge amount of sequencing data into information of functional and clinical relevance (genome annotation project). The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 10,000 diseases in humans are monogenic, i.e., that these diseases are caused by mutations within single genes (Jackson et al. in Essays Biochem 62:643-723, 2018). NGS technologies are continuously improving while our knowledge on genetic mutations driving the development of diseases is also still emerging (Giani et al. in Comput Struct Biotechnol J 18:9-19, 2020). It would be desirable to have tools that allow one to correct these genetic mutations, so-called genome editing tools. Apart from applications in biotechnology, medicine, and agriculture, it is still not concisely understood in basic science how genotype influences phenotype. Firstly, the Cre/loxP system and RNA-based technologies for gene knockout or knockdown are explained. Secondly, zinc-finger (ZnF) nucleases and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) are discussed as targeted genome editing systems.

We study the part of Galilean geometry that does not depend on the parallel postulate (briefly called absolute isotropic geometry) and their models (isotropic planes). After an axiomatic foundation of absolute isotropic geometry, we develop the basic theory of isotropic planes, prove the theorem of Saccheri for the angle sum of a triangle, and construct models of the different types of planes (over fields and skew fields of characteristic not equal 2).

This multi-rate behavior is described by a piecewise nonlinear model which evolves on a continuous and a discrete level. First, we present sufficient conditions which guarantee recursive constraint satisfaction for the closed-loop system. Afterwards, we propose a control design methodology which leverages Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for low level control and Model Predictive Control (MPC) policies for high level planning. The control barrier function is designed using the full nonlinear dynamical model and the MPC is based on a simplified planning model. When the nonlinear system is control affine and the high level planning model is linear, the control actions are computed by solving convex optimization problems at each level of the hierarchy. Finally, we show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on a simulation example, where the low level control action is updated at a higher frequency than the high level command."

Strategy followed on each race will be a determining factor for the success of an athlete. The purpose of the present study was to create and validate an instrument aiming to study this aspect of the competition, called Analysis of the Mountain Race Strategy (AMRS), through the Delphi method with the participation of a panel of experts formed by 5 coaches with more than 10 years of experience in their profession. Based on a bibliographic review, three attributable influence factors were determined: a) the Competition, b) the Athlete, and c) the mixed one: Competition and Athlete. This starting point allowed preparing the first draft of the questionnaire which was validated twice by the panel of experts considering three items: univocity, relevance, and importance. At the end of this validation process a consensus on 27 statements that future runners will respond using a Likert scale (one to five) was reached.

Material and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 408 nursing mothers aged 15 to 52 years who brought their children for immunization in a tertiary hospital in Enugu, Nigeria. Data on sociodemographic profile, parity, dental visits were collected. The presence of dental caries was recorded using the World Health Organization criteria. Results: The prevalence of dental caries was 11.0%, and the mean DMFT was 0.18. There was a statistically significant association between level of education (p<0.001), past dental visit (p<0.001) and the occurrence of dental caries. Caries was more prevalent in the mandibular teeth than the maxillary teeth. The left mandibular first and second permanent molars had the highest occurrence of dental caries. Missing (M) component of the DMFT index was highest and the care index was low. The significant predictors of caries among nursing mothers were fair oral hygiene and having below tertiary education. Conclusion: The prevalence of caries and the care index were both low in this study population. The significant predictors of dental caries were a tertiary level of education and poor oral hygiene. Incorporating oral health education during postnatal care can help reduce dental caries' occurrence and complications among nursing mothers in the study population."

In this paper we show that there is not a unique way of defining ego networks when the existence of edges is uncertain, since there are two different ways of defining the neighborhood of a node in such network models. Therefore, we introduce two definitions of probabilistic ego networks, called V-Alters-Ego and F-Alters-Ego, both rooted in the literature. Following that, we investigate three fundamental measures (degree, betweenness and closeness) for each definition. We also propose a method to approximate betweenness of an ego node among the neighbors which are connected via shortest paths with length 2. We show that this approximation method is faster to compute and it has high correlation with ego betweenness under the V-Alters-Ego definition in many datasets. Therefore, it can be a reasonable alternative to represent the extent to which a node plays the role of an intermediate node among its neighbors."

A multiplex bilayer network is considered in the study where the disease is transmitted through a directed physical interaction network layer while the opinions are formed over a directed social network layer. Towards that end, an opinion dynamical model is considered over the social network which incorporates people's current opinion-dependent susceptibilities to considering the cautious measures. The disease transmission, on the other hand, is captured by network generalized Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Vigilant (SEIV) epidemic model which incorporates vigilant attitude in the society. Stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) of the network transmission model is carried out, and sufficient condition for exponential stability of the DFE is derived. The simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of the theoretical findings."

The pH, dissolved ammonium concentrations, ammonium adsorption capacity, and cation exchangeable capacity for the soil samples were analyzed in relation to an untreated control and treatment with compost under ambient temperature and different initial ammonium concentrations (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 70, and 100 mg/L). The amounts of ammonium adsorbed increased along with initial concentrations of dissolved ammonium for control and treatment with compost. The models evaluated in this study included the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. Ammonium adsorption was found to conform to the Freundlich equation isotherm more than that with Langmuir. The highest adsorption capacity was exhibited by 100 mg/L added initial ammonium concentration. Adding compost as a source of organic matter enhanced the adsorption capacity of calcareous soil with an increase in the adsorption of 36%, which indicated that the organic matter is a key limiting parameter in the mechanism of ammonium adsorption. Ammonium adsorption by calcareous soils is an important process in identifying the ammonium nitrogen route in soil-water systems."

Tanks are the main source of water for farming and they act as sinks for agricultural run-offs. Environmental toxicants are adsorbed by bottom sediments and can be released into the adjacent water column due to environmental changes as those are not permanently bound. Therefore, this study attempts to determine the contamination situation of the selected toxic metals in sediments of the tanks in a CKDu prevalence distrct (Anuradhapura) in Sri Lanka and prediction of the risk. Sixteen tanks were selected and sediment samples were randomly collected from each tank from bank to center. Digested sediment samples were analyzed for heavy metals using Inductive Couple Plasma Mass Spectrometry and Calcium and Magnesium contents were analyzed using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry. According to the statistics, average values of some toxic metals such as As, Pb, and Cr in sediments were higher than severe effect levels (SEL) while most of the mean values of Cd, As, Pb, Cr, Zn, and Cu were beyond the Lowest effect levels (LEL). Apart from that, Geo Accumulation Indexes (I-geo) Indicate that almost all tanks in Anuradhapura district have moderately polluted with above mentioned pollutants. Hence, findings reveal about a risk generated on aquatic lives in the tanks as well as humans via food chain contamination with hazardous metals."

Compared to computer vision, human visual system can identify a target from complex backgrounds quickly and accurately. This paper proposes a new network model deriving from Where-What Networks (WWNs), which can approximately simulate the information processing pathways (i.e., dorsal pathway and ventral pathway) of human visual cortex and recognize different types of faces with different locations and sizes in complex background. To enhance the recognition performance, synapse maintenance mechanism and neuron regenesis mechanism are both introduced. Synapse maintenance is used to reduce the background interference while neuron regenesis mechanism is introduced to regulate the neuron resource dynamically to improve the network usage efficiency. Experiments have been conducted on human face images of 5 types, 11 sizes, and 225 locations in complex backgrounds. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed WWN model can basically learn three concepts (type, location and size) simultaneously. The experiment results also show the advantages of the enhanced WWN-7 model for face recognition in comparison with several existing methods."

Results show that Forough Farrokhzad has always been encountered with censorship and people's pessimism in our society that our traditional culture could not put up with her freedom that reflect her emotion, thoughts, and affections in her poems. These poems reflected both the difficulties she's been through and also echo her psychological problems including inferiority, submission, aggression, and dissociative disorder. Indeed, her self-disclosure, supremacy, and self-chosen solitude were intentional attempted to cover and healed her weaknesses. After analyzing about Forough, we identified that her negative attitude to world and pessimism has created paranoia in some of her poetry.

Phosphatase activity is shown by Phosphatase and Tensin homolog (PTEN) protein encoded by PTEN gene localized on human chromosome 10. Earlier findings established the role of PTEN as a tumor suppressor in Cowden's disease, where PTEN mutations resulted in disease outcomes. Subsequent studies found the role of PTEN mutations in various human cancers, making it one of the vastly studied tumor suppressor genes. The current review has been planned to get a deeper insight into the potential role of PTEN in a variety of physiological processes involved in normal development like cell growth, migration, and differentiation along with the factors, regulation, and underlying mechanism."

Twenty-six male players with an average age of 20.7 years (SD = 1.7), belonging to the representative soccer teams of two Mexican universities participated in the research. Morphological, body composition, and physical characteristics were measured for the defense, midfield, and forward positions. The level of association between variables was determined. The results show that defenders have greater body mass, humerus diameter, and hip circumference than forwards (p <. 05), whereas no differences were found in comparison to midfielders. There is no difference in players' expression of physical abilities and percentage of fat mass by playing position (p > .05). Fat mass was directly associated with speed (.427 *, p < .05). Differences were found in bone and body mass by playing position between defenders, midfielders, and forwards.

The sports environment surrounding young soccer players is of paramount importance for their proper sports, personal, and social development. An analysis of players' perception is necessary to evaluate it. In this study, the objective is to understand young soccer players' perception of the youth sports environment (parents, athletes and coaches), according to sports category. The design used in the research was cross-sectional, retrospective, descriptive, and correlational. The sample was composed of 99 young soccer players, all of them male. The instrument used was the Perception of the Youth Sports Environment (CPEDJ) questionnaire of Carratala, Gutierrez, Guzman and Pablos (2011). It is noted that the higher is the sports category, the worse is players' perception about refereeing. Also, parents are seen as less respectful, and coaches less educating. A positive relationship between educating coaches and respectful parents is identified. It seems that players perceive that when coaches act more as educators, parents are more respectful. Finally, a positive relationship between good refereeing and sports facilities is observed."

This paper analyses which interactions provide valuable information for the energy system and how future water use projection could be conducted with the help of energy system modelling. It was assumed that different national climate policy scenarios for the energy system influence the water projections. The interactions considered for the German case study are: water demand for cooling technologies, irrigation practices of energy crops, as well as literature based assessments of total water demand and renewable water availability. Based on the energy scenario analysis, water use for the energy system will shift over time from cooling water use to irrigation water use for energy crops and the amount of irrigation water use is dependent on the demand of biomass which increases for stricter climate targets. There is a small risk of future water stress that can be eliminated through the use of recycled water for irrigation."

This dynamic affects police officers' stress levels, as well as their personal and occupational risk factors. This study analyzed the impact of a training strategy implemented with 76 uniformed personnel dedicated to crime prevention and peaceful coexistence, using breathing exercises from the HeartMath Institute's heart and quick coherence techniques, with innovative biofeedback and measurement equipment. The results show that the officers were able to significantly reduce their average heart rate, improving their ability to breathe in a controlled manner during their routine activities. This reduced heart rate reactivity reveals improved police performance."

In this way, it reviews two experiences of public action programs in the municipal government of Medellin that were concerned with combining the understanding of behavioral insights, community rules, and population representations and perceptions to design interventions that exceed the approaches of similar traditional programs. Thus, this text assumes the question of public innovation about its concern for social change and the resolution of public problems since the introduction of ideas about the behavior of individuals in the design and implementation of public programs and policies from local governments."
