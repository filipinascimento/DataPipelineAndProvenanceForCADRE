"WOS:000535804800001"	"Yes"	"gold_doaj"	"Today, industrialization and urbanization in large cities cause an increase in the surfaces covered with manmade objects such as concrete and asphalt. The expansion of urban areas and increase in the using materials with high heat storage properties, directly affect the Land Surface Temperature (LST), which shows an increase in the sensible temperature of the region. LST is directly connected to the natural green vegetation of the land and varies widely in large urban areas, these differences related to the temperature is defined as the `urban heat island'. In this study, it was investigated the temporal variation of land surface temperature due to urbanization. Bursa, which is considered as a study area, has shown a rapid population increase since 1990 and a rapid increase in the number of buildings with the impact of urbanization and industrialisation. To determine the effect of this urbanization and industrialisation on land surface temperature, temporal change analysis of the surface temperature in the Bursa was observed with Landsat satellite images of 1988, 1998, 2008 and 2018. From produced maps, it was observed that the amount of green vegetation in urban areas decreased and as a consequence of this decrease, the surface temperature increased in the urban areas."

We consider a general attack model, in which the attacker action is only constrained through the frequency and duration of DoS attacks. We propose a distributed iterative localization algorithm with an abandonment strategy based on the barycentric coordinate of a sensor with respect to its neighbors, which is computed through relative distance measurements. In particular, if a sensor's communication links for receiving its neighbors' information lose packets due to DoS attacks, then the sensor abandons the location estimation. When the attacker launches DoS attacks, the AS-DILOC algorithm is proved theoretically to be able to accurately locate the sensors regardless of the attack strategy at each time. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through simulation examples."

The surface morphology of prepared samples was observed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The magnetic parameters were studied at room temperature with VSM, and the observed results are discussed with composition. The DC electrical properties were studied using a two-probe method in the temperature range from room temperature to well beyond Curie temperature. Thermoelectric power studies were carried out from room temperature to well beyond transition temperature with a differential method. The Seebeck coefficient variation with temperature was studied, and it shows the prepared samples are classified as n-type semiconductors.

Objective: To analyze the differences in functional Fitness (FF) associated with gender, age and physical activity (PA ), and to compare the FF scores of Borbenses with other populations. Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out, comprising 233 elderly (71,2-18,9 yrs old; range between 60,0 to 95,7 yrs old). The FF was evaluated using the Senior Fitness Test battery and PA was estimated by questionnaire. Result: After controlling for age and PA, sex-related differences in FF were only found in shoulder flexibility (favoring women) and in aerobic endurance (AE, favoring men). There were age-related differences in lower body strength (LBS) and AE in both genders and in agility/dynamic balance in men, and upper body strength in women, only, (favoring the younger age group). PA-related differences in FF were only found in Mink flexibility (favoring the active group). Borba population had higher scores in the trunk flexibility than both samples studied and higher scores in shoulder flexibility than Madeiran, only. Conclusion: Except for flexibility and AE, our results indicated FF homogeneity between men and women. The oldest men and women underperformed in LBS and AE. The rest of the FF components may be more dependent on other related factors such as sex, lifestyles, and the environment. Taking into consideration the reference population from the US and Portugal, Borba population underperformed on the majority of FF components, with the exception of flexibility."

The secret in this system includes the shared key algorithm and the public key. By using the Quantum Cryptography technique, a more secure communication network is achieved. This technique of Quantum Cryptography is based on the following two elements, photon polarization and the principle of uncertainty. Photon polarization ensures that an eavesdropper cannot copy or even try to read the information which is being transmitted by using photons. The principle of uncertainty states that it is impossible to measure or observe the state of photons without disturbing their actual state.

Application of a positive gate bias for variable time-periods led to displacements of the transfer curves in the positive gate bias direction. On switching off the gate bias, the transfer curves returned close to their pre-stress state on a timescale similar to that when the gate bias was switched on. The time dependence of the threshold voltage shift is described well by a stretched-exponential model.

Further treatment is needed in order to ensure that the effluent is safe for disposal or reuse. This work was conducted to evaluate the performance of an electrocoagulation process in removing pollutants from the anaerobically-pretreated palm oil mill effluent. A 1000 ml beaker glass equipped with a magnetic stirrer was used as an electrocoagulation reactor with four plates of aluminum electrode @ 12x2 cm and an effective area of 0.1 m(2) arranged in a bipolar configuration. The experiments run in a batch mode were carried out at various voltage levels and contact times, namely 10, 15, and 20 V for 15, 30, 45 and 60 min. The level of pollutant removal and electrical energy consumption were determined. The electrocoagulation process at 15 V for 30 min produced the highest level of pollutant removal for TSS, turbidity, color, COD, and BOD5, i.e. 90%, 86%, 93%, 87%, and 97%, respectively. The estimated operating costs for these process conditions are 1.48 USD/m(3). A second order empirical model was developed to describe the TSS removal in the POME electrocoagulation process. The electrocoagulation with aluminum electrodes can significantly reduce various types of pollutants of anaerobically-pretreated POME, such as TSS, turbidity, color, COD, and BOD5. The estimated cost of EC operation is cheaper than the chemical coagulation process."

The NCM uses a deep long short-term memory recurrent neural network for a global approximation of an optimal contraction metric, the existence of which is a necessary and sufficient condition for exponential stability of nonlinear systems. The optimality stems from the fact that the contraction metrics sampled offline are the solutions of a convex optimization problem to minimize an upper bound of the steady-state Euclidean distance between perturbed and unperturbed system trajectories. We demonstrate how to exploit NCMs to design an online optimal estimator and controller for nonlinear systems with bounded disturbances utilizing their duality. The performance of our framework is illustrated through Lorenz oscillator state estimation and spacecraft optimal motion planning problems."

In particular, we investigate how model uncertainty in the time derivative of a CBF can be reduced via learning, and how this leads to stronger statements on the safe behavior of a system. To this end, we build upon the idea of Input-to-State Safety (ISSf) to define Projection-to-State Safety (PSSf), which characterizes degradation in safety in terms of a projected disturbance. This enables the direct quantification of both how learning can improve safety guarantees, and how bounds on learning error translate to bounds on degradation in safety. We demonstrate that a practical episodic learning approach can use PSSf to reduce uncertainty and improve safety guarantees in simulation and experimentally."

However, the supply of clean water had led to a decrease as pollutants such as dyes had caused a major negative impact on pure and clean main water bodies. In recent years, textile industries have developed and contributed to more than 50% of dye wastewaters in the world. The improper method of discharging dye effluent to the aquatic environment caused the destruction of habitat and degradation of water quality. Advanced treatments such as photocatalysis, electrooxidation, the Fenton process, and biological treatment via bacterium are often used for dye wastewaters. However, these treatment processes are often expensive in operation and maintenance. In conjunction, adsorption is one of the efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly treatment methods. The adsorbent most widely used is the activated carbon adsorbent. Activated carbon comes in two forms, granular activated carbon (GAC) and powdered activated carbon (PAC). There are two methods to activation of carbon that are physical activation and chemical activation. The factors affecting the efficiency of adsorption are the adsorbent dosage, dye concentration, pH value, and temperature. In this article, the efficiency of dye wastewater treatment via adsorption is discussed. Several waste materials are being studied especially agricultural biomass as it has little or no economic value and often poses disposal issues. Some low-cost agricultural biomass-based adsorbents such as tea waste, hazelnut husk, bacteria aggregate, rice ash, pineapple leaf, and fruit waste have been tested to be effective in the dye removal process. There are mainly four categories of agricultural biomass-derived adsorbent, such as leaf-based, peel-based, stem-based, and seed-based adsorbents."

The specimen was exposed to microwave radiation and its volatile constituents were gathered via the fiber from the specimen headspace and straightly inserted into a GC-MS addition port for investigation. A simplex technique was utilized for optimizing three various factors influencing the extraction effectiveness. Under the enhanced circumstances (with the sample weight of 2 g, extraction time of 2.0 min and microwave power of 300 W), the PMO-IL nanoporous fiber could proficiently adsorb volatile components of Stachys lavandulifolia. In optimum conditions, the repeatability for one fiber (n = 3), expressed as relative standard deviation (R.S.D.%), was between 3.5% and 12.1% for the test compounds. The suggested technique, relative to hydrodistillation can equally be used to monitor all the sample components easily, though it will require less sample quantity and duration. A few experiments based on the simplex method proved it would be fast and efficient method to optimize the micro-extraction conditions."

Such methods however, may become unstable when regressors are time-varying. Inspired by techniques employed in adaptive systems, this letter proposes a new variational perspective to derive four higher order tuners with provable stability guarantees. This perspective includes concepts based on higher order tuners and normalization and allows stability to be established for problems with time-varying regressors. The stability analysis builds on a novel technique which stems from symplectic mechanics, that links Lagrangians and Hamiltonians to the underlying Lyapunov stability analysis, and is provided for common linear-in-parameter models."

In this study, an android based application has been developed by incorporating medical data received from the patient affected with appendicitis. A total of 200 subjects data, including case and control group, has been examined and correlated with the common risk factors like fever, fever runs, appetite, abdominal pain, pain qualification, vomiting, rate of nausea, migration pain clinical symptom, which may suggest strongly significant to have appendicitis. Feature selection technique (correlation, information gain, gain ratio, relief, and symmetrical uncertainty) has been used to figure out the best relevant features. A predictive Apriori algorithm has been applied to find out the best rules for appendicitis. From the best rules, a risk score table has been generated and developed a risk flowchart, which will correctly identify 99 patients among 100 affected patients between the risk levels of medium to very high. At long last, this flowchart has used to develop a risk prediction application. Finally, the developed Predict Appendix application will be helpful to predict the risk level of appendicitis not only among peoples of Bangladesh but also all over the world and, at the same time, increase awareness."

Worn out tire rubber forms a considerable section of the urban waste materials. It is able to be ground and known as ground tire rubber (GTR). It is favored to be devulcanized before being blended with organic or inorganic materials. (GTR) is able to constitute compatible blends or composites with polymers that possess appropriate mechanical, thermal, and morphological properties. Devulcanization process of waste rubber takes place by means of mechanical, mechano-chemical, or thermal treatment. Moreover, induced irradiation such as gamma or ultraviolet and accelerated electrons radiation(s) can assist in devulcanizing waste rubber by breaking the bonds which arose previously during the vulcanization process. Radiation is able to modify waste rubber by grafting its surface for an enhanced interfacial adhesion between it and the blended plastic or rubber. Loading GTR as a filler in composites contributes to lowering the cost of the resulting materials. In addition, modifying GTR can improve the performance of the composites in which they contribute. In this review, we aim to employ reclaimed waste rubber for a greener environment with better waste management procedures."

Objective: To describe the spatiotemporal variables of the sprint pattern developed on natural and artificial turf by professional female soccer players. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on nineteen (n=19) professional athletes with an average age of 22.3 years, who's sprint spatiotemporal variables were evaluated in a natural (Berniuda 419) and artificial (Star 2) playing field through an optical measurement system (Opto Gait, Italy). The analysis of the differences of the space and time variables by turf was done with the Wilcoxon test for paired data and the differences in speed and acceleration by playing position was done using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The Spearman test was used to compare the correlation between speed, acceleration and anthropometric variables. Finally, an alpha level of 5% was considered for the whole analysis. Results: On the natural turf, the speed and cadence of the players were higher, on the artificial turf, the energy, flight time, contact phase and step angle were higher (p<0.05). On the other hand, an indirect relationship was observed between speed, contact time, percentage and fat weight (p=0.01). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the natural turf, Bennuda 419, allows for a faster sprinting patterns, characterized by lower energy use, flight time, contact phase and step angle."

The sample of this work consisted of those permanent orientation circuits whose existence in Spain could be verified (n = 115). The search for the sample was carried out mainly through the Google search engine. After this search, various variables such as the year of creation, place where it is located, modality, environment, control system, etc., were analyzed through SPSS 20.0 using descriptive and inferential statistics. From the results, a growing trend can be observed in the number of permanent orienteering circuits, being the first circuit inaugurated in 2004. The predominant modality is the O-pie, and as for the type of environment, in open the natural environment and in limited environments the parks. The most used control system is the beacon edited with point codes, letters, etc. It can be concluded that the permanent orienteering circuits have been increasing over the years, having a considerable increase in the last 5 years compared to the previous years.

In order to eliminate the spiral marks, it is necessary to clarify the cause of the spiral marks on the surface of the rolled piece. Based on the analysis of the kinematics of the three-roll skew rolled hollow axles, the spiral marks is caused by the spiral pitch of the rolled piece being larger than the width of the finishing section of the roller. Increasing the rotation speed of the roller can reduce the spiral pitch of the rolled piece, thereby avoiding the appearance of spiral marks.

The strategy was evaluated through a participant observation (active and passive) and mixed-methods surveys answered by the students. Results point out that most participants responded positively to the activities proposed. The reported levels of motivation and engagement also indicate the capabilities of this strategy as a method to enhance the learning experience of students. Despite these positive outcomes, challenges like the impact on working practices of teachers or the long-term engagement of gameful approaches requires additional research."

The closed-loop dynamics are required to satisfy ideal on-axis attitude and rate response characteristics. Additionally, robust command tracking and suppression of off-axis responses are required in the presence of matched and unmatched uncertainties. Lyapunov based theoretical proofs are utilized for the tracking problem via application of a continuous second-order sliding mode (SOSM) controller. A second order sliding mode observer is employed to estimate the higher derivatives of the sliding variable for the output feedback controller. Simulations in hover illustrate the continuity, smoothness, and robustness properties of the proposed controller as compared to a conventional sliding mode controller and a linear quadratic controller."

Previously malarial areas show a lower risk than other provinces of the same regions: Mantua (Lombardy) RR=0.94 (CI95%0.89-0.99); Venice-Rovigo (Veneto) RR=0.61 (CI95%0.58-0.65); Ferrara-Ravenna (Emilia-Romagna) RR=0.37 (CI95%0.35-0.41); Cagliari-Oristano-SouthSardinia (Sardinia) RR=0.25 (0.17-0.31). The maximum temperature in March 2020 in those provinces was higher in mean 1.5 degrees for other provinces. The lower frequency of COVID-19 in the provinces previously exposed to Malaria of four Italian regions does not reveal a causal link. The phenomenon has emerged independently in all the regions investigated. People born between the 1920s and 1950s were those most exposed to malaria years ago and today are the most exposed to the severest forms of COVID-19. A warmer climate seems to be associated with a lower risk of COVID, in line with the evidence highlighted in equatorial states where a lower lethality of the virus has emerged, however this regardless of the presence of Malaria. This may suggest that climate and not Malaria is the real risk factor, though further studies need to determine the role of the association climate / COVID."

In the control system, it is assumed that a control operator, namely a human controller, determines the control actions based on his/her tendency toward laziness. The tendency is described by a cost function that includes the L-2 norm of the state and the L-1 norm of the control action. Then, the operator behavior is modeled by the solution to the optimization problem formulated with the L-2-state/L-1-action cost function and the plantmodel. The tendencymodeling is reduced to the problem of estimating the cost function. The estimation problem is further extended by taking into account the operator dynamics caused by the recognition and motion to derive an MPC-based formulation.

The emergency has forced European governments to close the schools and consequently, all the schooling activities have been transferred online. Referring to some works of Giorgio Agamben. Paul Virilio and Walter Benjamin the authors propose some critical remarks on the transformation of schooling space and schooling time that characterizes the practice of distance learning. This transformation pertains not only to accidental aspects of schooling but affects the very identity of the schooling experience. In a completely digitalized school, time is characterized by instantaneousness: time as duration is replaced by the .time of exposure), as stated by Paul Virilio. In addition, the school completely dematerialized, is reduced to the two-dimensional space of the screen. The article aims to show that instantaneous time and dematerialized space make the experience of (crossing, difficult. Therefore, following some remarks by Jan Masschelein and Gert Biesta, it is maintained that the experience of (crossing, endangered by the digitalization of schooling is essential to an authentic experience of schooling. It is not intended to refuse the digital innovations as such but to put them on the table', in order to suspend their immediate use and analyze them critically."

The light curves of the flickering source are derived after removal of the contribution of the red giant and account of the interstellar extinction. Many LCs show repeating time structures with approximately similar shapes. In this work we select 25 LCs (12 in B band and 13 in V band), with monitoring times 62-223 min, where the main time structures with quasi-periods 16-56 min repeat 3-7 times. We derive combined (averaged) profiles the structure and characterize them by shape parameters. The average SNR of the combined profiles is 26, from 10 to 43. In 2009-2017 the asymmetry (skewness ) of the shape varies gradually from positive to negative. Simultaneously, higher brightness and redder color indexes of the flickering source (in 2009-2010 or 2016-2017) correspond to positive or negative asymmetry of the combined profile."

The time series data compiled from various sources including UNDP annual Human Development Reports, SPDC Social Development report, Pakistan Review 2005-06, World Bank and KOF. A semi-log model was used to explain the relationship, whereas some other models were also used to test the mobility of the variables. The test applied is ADF test and on the basis of ADF test results, the ARDL method of co integration was used to test long run impact of all independent variables on human development index. From the findings, we may conclude that globalization overall and social, political and economic globalization have positive impact on human development index for Pakistan, whereas some control variables like population density effects positively, and greenhouse gas emissions significantly and negatively affect the globalization. It is suggested that in order to improve the globalization, it is mandatory to focus on indirect effects of globalization and make necessary plans to reduce such emissions."

In this regard, a segment of companies that have specific characteristics that stand out in investment policies are like family businesses. Thus, the objective of the research was to analyze the impact of the structure of family ownership on investment decisions of Brazilian companies between periods of protection crisis (2009-2013), as these periods were considered satisfactory for the economy and for institutional normality. Methodology: The study presents a model of multiple linear regressions designed to test the impact of several variables on a dependent variable in a simultaneous relationship. The dependent variable consisted of the CapEx investment index made by the companies. The variable of interest was a dummy variable whether the company was familiar or not. In addition, tests were carried out to identify the company's moments, that is, to test the behavior of companies when they were better or worse than their unfamiliar competitors. Results: The results corroborate the assumptions of self-preservation, since family companies invested 13.5% less than non-family companies. However, family businesses when they perform worse than their competitors invest up to 24% more than non-family businesses. Thus, the research supports the hypothesis that family businesses are more aligned with the self-preservation behavior in investment decisions. Theoretical contributions: The research provides an analysis of the so-called mixed-gambles of family businesses, that is, risk aversion and the search for the company's perpetuity, which is demonstrated by the dummy variable and the complementary tests with favorable and unfavorable economic situations. Practical contributions: Results were found that point to the behavior of greater self-preservation of Brazilian companies in relation to their investments."

Due to its diffuse and informal nature, monitoring the effects that they cause in these territories is difficult, therefore the study of its sports events can be a good opportunity to build a national image on these modalities in the view of future management. Through the systematization and subsequent georeferencing of 677 mountain bike events that took place in 2018 in Portugal, it was possible to identify some of its main characteristics. Competitive Marathons/Raids/Routes and non-competitive Tours are the submodalities or typologies that bring together the greatest offer and most participants. Its distribution is national and is characterized by having on average, although with a certain variability by typology, 1.5 courses, 50.6 km, and 228 participants. In seasonal terms, most events take place in the spring and autumn periods. Since 29.7% of the national territory is included in the national system of classified areas and 62.9% of the events take place in or near these, it is evident that these territories play an important role in the distribution of the offer, reinforcing the importance of this study."

The research was qualitative, developed from a case study: two teachers from each unit: one group teacher and one physical education teacher in each school. The methods used were phenomenological and hermeneutic, supported by the analytical-synthetic and theoretical-deductive approaches. In-depth interviews and bibliographical techniques were used as information-gathering tools. The analysis of the discourse was supported in the typologies and level of reflection postured by Viciana, Delgado and Del Villar (1997). The results highlight distant approaches to established definitions of reference among actors in public and private primary education. Their speeches indicate partial and barely explanatory attributes when compared to those raised at the national level for Mexico by the Secretary of Public Education (SEP) and in the international context by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). However, in the speeches it is possible to detect partial similarities with standards close to the current perspectives and pedagogical orientation of PE; at present, there is the need to respond to the paradigm of the multidimensional human being in the process of building their life, and PE supports the integral line of well-being and its development in different contexts."

Recent Findings The paradigm for the optimal management of PAH has shifted in recent years. Upfront combination therapy with an endothelin receptor antagonist and a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor is now widely accepted as standard of care. In addition, there is increasing emphasis on starting prostanoids early in order to delay time to clinical worsening. However, less is known regarding which prostanoid agent to initiate and the optimum time to do so. In order to facilitate shared decision-making, there is an increasing need for decision tools based on guidelines and collective clinical experiences to navigate between pharmacologic and interventional treatments, as well as explore innovative, therapeutic pathways for PAH. The management of PAH has become increasingly complex. With a growing number of PAH-specific therapies, intimate knowledge of the therapeutics and the potential barriers to adherence are integral to providing optimal care for this high-risk patient population. While current PAH-specific therapies largely mediate their effects through pulmonary vasodilation, ongoing research efforts are focused on ways to disrupt the mechanisms leading to pulmonary vascular remodeling. By targeting aberrations identified in the metabolism and proliferative state of pulmonary vascular cells, novel PAH treatment pathways may be just on the horizon."

The effect of different parameters on enzyme production and its activity was determined. An extracellular halophilic and moderately thermophilic amylase was produced under stress conditions in culture medium containing 23 % salts by a newly isolated haloarchaeal strain, D61. The strain was identified, and the effect of NaCl, pH, temperature, and different nutrition factors on amylase production by the strain was examined. The enzyme was partially purified using gel filtration chromatography and then characterized. According to the biochemical and morphological characterization and analysis of the sequence of 16S rRNA gene, the strain was identified as Haloarcula sp. strain D61. The strain was capable of producing amylase in the presence of NaCl, and the maximum amylase production was at 3-4 M NaCl. Optimum temperature and pH for the enzyme production were detected to be 40-45 degrees C and 7.0, respectively. Among various carbon sources, maltose induced amylase production, while lactose, sucrose, and glucose repressed the production of the enzyme. MgCl2 was necessary for growth and amylase production by the strain, and no growth and enzyme production was observed in the absence of MgCl2. The optimum activity of the amylase was at pH 6.0, temperatures of 35-40 degrees C, and 3-5 M NaCl, as the amylase needs NaCl for its activity. Halophilic and moderate thermophilic amylases could be a good option for biotechnological applications or basic studies on enzyme structure to find differences between halophilic and mesophilic enzymes.

QPA employs specific G-rich sequences as primers that, upon polymerase elongation at specific temperatures, spontaneously dissociate from the primer binding sites (PBS) and fold into a monomolecular quadruplex. Fluorescent nucleotide analogs, such as 3-methyl isoxanthopterin (3MI), when incorporated into these primers, emit light upon a quadruplex formation and permit simple, specific, and sensitive quantification without the attachment of probe molecules. Previously has developed QPA assays with truncated targets and potassium cations that demonstrate an optimal amplification around 55 degrees C. Here, we designed QPA assays with truncated target and led cations at a range of human body temperature. Lead cations reveal the most rapid amplification than potassium and strontium cations. QPA can be applied as a method for the implementation of simple and cheap diagnostics (point of care (POC)), as well as development at a range of 35-45 degrees C temperature, which will make this method more convenient for using it in molecular diagnostics."

The sample consisted of 39 players (15.9 +/- 1.0 years of age) grouped by the outcome of the games, winning (17), drawing (6), and losing (16). Physical and physiological responses were quantified using a portable GPS and a cardiac monitor. The rating of perceived exertion was measured using the BORG 6-20 scale. Technical-tactical responses were assessed according to the frequency and quality of execution of technical skills and core tactical principles. Shapiro-Wilk, Kruskal-Wallis, Mann Whitney U and Multinomial Logistic Regression tests were used in the analysis Significance was set at 5%. Players in the groups winning and drawing covered greater distances in low-intensity running and shorter distances in walking The drawing group executed more passes than the losing group (14.0 vs 10.0). The winning group showed greater efficiency of execution in three offensive and three defensive principles compared to the losing group. It was found that the increase in the efficiency of execution of offensive and defensive principles increases the chances of the players being in drawing (11 to 24%) or winning (10% to 21%) groups in relation to losing. It is concluded that the physical, technical, and tactical responses influence competitive success, and the increase in tactical efficiency results in more chances to achieve winning or drawing."

However, there is no confirmation of their influence on the performance of varsity volleyball players. This study aimed to verify the effect of Submaximal Running (SR) and Passive Static Stretching (PSS) on the performance of college volleyball athletes during Contra Movement Jump (CMJ) and 10-meter sprint tests. Thirteen male athletes were randomly invited to perform two functional tests (CMJ and 10-meter sprint) under three different conditions: 1) control condition (CC), 2) after PSS, and 3) after an SR. Performance at CMJ and 10-meter sprint were assessed through smartphone applications. SR-subjected individuals presented a significantly better performance at CMJ test when compared to PSS (p = 0.01). However, there was no difference between the experimental and control conditions (p> 0.05). In addition, there was no significant difference in sprint time and speed at the 10-meter sprint test between the analyzed conditions (p = 0.7 and p = 0.6, respectively). We can conclude that submaximal running can be better than static stretching to improve the performance of college volleyball athletes."

A model assessment of qualitative effects associated with the development of a succession of aquatic communities during degradation of the ecosystem requires expanding the boundaries of the conventional approach. This raises the question of changing the structure of the reservoir ecosystem model. An idea of the Darwin's principle of natural selection is the key point for assessing changes in the biodiversity structure. The problem was solved through consideration of changes in physiological activities of hydrobionts. The study based on biogeochemical cycles modelling revealed the change in the structure of the ecosystem. Also the novelty of the work is in the implementation of the method for structural-dynamic modelling to assess the trend of long-term eutrophication of the Novosibirsk reservoir, the largest in Western Siberia."

The development of strong relationship links with the release of root exudates from plants. Diverse community of soil microorganisms depends on these exudations, establishing a strong interaction from growth promotion to parasitism. PGPR may compete for nutrients against pathogens, produces systematic resistance and antibiotics. They may promote plant growth through phytohormones and solubilizing minerals that affects the plant growth. The biological control of plant diseases through microbial-inoculants have enough potential for a large market share throughout the world, with annual growth-rate of almost 15-20%. The application of microbial based products is an eco-friendly approach and are the most suitable option for reducing the application of chemical fertilizers. The problem with microbial approach comes under field conditions where these microbes have to compete with various biotic and abiotic stresses. Marketing and commercialization are other important factors. However, success of marketing and commercialization is heavily dependent on advancement and improvements in interdisciplinary research, formulation methods, large-scale production, awareness and education of farming community. There is dire need to introduce an integrated approach of microbial based inoculation along with chemical one."

As one of schemes to detect cyber attack, IDS has been widely used. IDS can detect cyber attack based on the signature which is the pattern of cyber attack and so on. There are signature-based and anomaly-based detection methods in terms of IDS. Signature detection compares activity and behavior to signatures of known attacks. Signatures need to be updated regularly to detect a new type of attacks. This paper considers extended stochastic models for a server system with signature update. The server has the function of IDS. In this model, we consider type II error where IDS judges the occurrence of cyber attack erroneously when it occurs. We assume that the check with signature update is performed at Nth check or every k checks. We obtain the expected costs until cyber attack is detected and discuss the optimal policies which minimize them. Finally, numerical examples are given."

This study attempts to perform an acceptance evaluation of online strategic video games, particularly multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), using an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) developed in the current literature and establish a predictive value in determining the behavioral intention in playing online strategic video games. To carry out this objective, a case study consisting of 439 undergraduate students as a sample was conducted. After the data filtering process which involves the removal of insincere responses and non-engaging responses and of those who have not played MOBA games, 278 research participants became the final sample. The questionnaire was created and underwent reliability analysis. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was computed to show the relatedness of each factor as well as to determine its validity and internal reliability. Nine factors were considered in this work that tested for significant relationships and predictive capabilities using structural equation modeling with AMOS software. These factors include altruism, social interaction, use context, perceived ease of enjoyment, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude, flow, and behavior intention. Results show that the significant determinants of user behavior intention are the flow, attitude, and perceived ease of use while the perceived enjoyment, social interaction significantly influence attitudes in playing online strategic video games, use context, and flow. Furthermore, this work also demonstrates that altruism, social interaction, use context, perceived enjoyment, flow, and attitude are significant factors that can be added to extend TAM. These findings would serve as guidelines in the formulation of principles for game design and development."

The dual cases of 1-norm and infinity-norm bounds are considered. In both cases, if the systems at the nodes are diagonal, we get a necessary and sufficient condition.

The flow is resolved by considering the RANS (Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes) equations. The baseline geometry is based on the NACA 0021 profile. The wavy leading edge has an amplitude of 3% and wavelength of 11%, both with respect to the airfoil chord. Cases without and with wavy leading edges are simulated and compared. Initially, studies of the numerical sensitivity with respect to the obtained results, considering aspects such as turbulence modeling and mesh refinement, are carried out as well as by comparison with corresponding results in the literature. Numerical data such as pressure distribution, shear stress lines on the wing surface, and aerodynamics coefficients are used to describe and investigate the flow features around the wavy leading airfoil. Comparisons between the straight leading edge and the wavy leading edge cases shows an increase of the maximum lift coefficient as well as stall angle for the wavy leading edge configuration. In addition, at an angle of attack near the stall, the present numerical results shows an increase of the drag coefficient with the wavy leading edge airfoil when compared with the corresponding straight leading edge case."

The research results show that the improved advertising costs and revenue sharing contract can perfectly coordinate the dual-channel supply chain system. Numerical experiments illustrate the impacts of parameters on the optimal decision results."

In order to evaluate the potential of C. muelleri to be used for the nutrient removal and biomass production from eutrophic saline wastewaters, the algae were cultured under a wide range of temperature, salinity, photoperiod, and light intensity. The optimum temperature for the biomass production was observed at 30 degrees C, but the algae could maintain at least 66% of the highest production between 20 degrees C and 35 degrees C. The optimum salinity for the biomass production was 25, but the algae could maintain at least 22% of the highest production between 10 and 30. Both light intensity and photoperiod affected the algal biomass production, and the minimum light requirement was considered 100 mu mol m(-2).s(-1) for 6 hours to maintain the biomass production and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) absorption. Throughout all the experiments, the N and P absorption increased with the biomass production, but the ratio of N and P to the biomass exponentially decreased with the biomass production. These results showed that C. muelleri is tolerant to the wide range of environmental conditions, absorbing nutrients and producing organic matter. C. muelleri has a great potential to be introduced in the water treatment processes, especially where the temperature and salinity fluctuate."

In particular, a unified probabilistic decentralised consensus control framework is established where decentralised randomised controllers are designed such that the individual subsystems in a network synchronise their states with each other to achieve consensus of the whole network. The proposed framework is quite general, where all the components within this framework including local controllers, systems' models, and communications between the subsystems of a complex system are modelled using probabilistic models. The general solution for arbitrary probabilistic models of the framework components is obtained then demonstrated on a class of linear Gaussian complex systems, thus obtaining the desired results.

Although the affine abstraction problem can be solved using a single linear program, existing approaches suffer from a computation space complexity that grows exponentially with the state dimension. Thus, the motivation for incremental abstraction is to reduce the space complexity of abstraction algorithms for high-dimensional systems or systems with limited on-board resources. Specifically, we start with an operating region that is a subregion of the state space and compute a pair of affine hyperplanes that bracket the nonlinear function locally. Then, by incrementally expanding the operating region, we dynamically update the two affine hyperplanes such that we eventually yield hyperplanes that are guaranteed to over-approximate the nonlinear system over the entire domain. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using several numerical examples."

However, most state-of-the-art learning-based nonlinear trajectory tracking controllers still lack any formal guarantees. In this letter, we exploit the property of differential flatness to design an online, robust learning-based controller to achieve both high tracking performance and probabilistically guarantee a uniform ultimate bound on the tracking error. A common control approach for differentially flat systems is to try to linearize the system by using a feedback (FB) linearization controller designed based on a nominal system model. Performance and safety are limited by the mismatch between the nominal model and the actual system. Our proposed approach uses a nonparametric Gaussian Process (GP) to both improve FB linearization and quantify, probabilistically, the uncertainty in our FB linearization. We use this probabilistic bound in a robust linear quadratic regulator (LQR) framework. Through simulation, we highlight that our proposed approach significantly outperforms alternative learning-based strategies that use differential flatness."

The measurement projects and the Real-time data processing are articulated to take advantage of this environment, fostering a sustainable data-driven decision making. The Data Stream Processing Strategy (DSPS) is a Stream Processing Engine focused on measurement projects, where each concept is previously agreed through a measurement framework. The Measurement Adapter (MA) is a component whose responsibility is to pair each metric's definition from the measurement project with data sensors to transmit data (i.e., measures) with metadata (i. e., tags indicating the data meaning) together. The Gathering Function (GF) receives and derivates data for its processing from each MA, while it implements load-shedding (LS) techniques based on Metadata to avoid a processing collapse when all MAs informs jointly and frequently. Here, a Metadata and Z-score based load-shedding technique implemented locally in the MA is proposed. Thus, the load-shedding is located at the same data source to avoid data transmission and saving resources. Also, an incremental estimation of average, deviations, covariance, and correlations are implemented and employed to calculate the Z-scores and to data retain/discard selectively. Four simulations discrete were designed and performed to analyze the proposal. Results indicate that the local LS required only 24% of the original data transmissions, a minimum of 18.61 ms as the data lifespan, while it consumes 890.26 KB. As future work, other kinds of dependencies analysis will be analyzed to provide local alternatives to LS."

The content analysis was focused on four research questions. A total of 22 relevant studies were found. Overall, only about one-third of the lead authors were affiliated with African universities. A majority of the studies were quantitative, and 78% of the studies were done for three countries: Ghana, Morocco, and Nigeria. There was either just one or no study on trust and conflict, partner selection, and human resource management (HRM). At the contextual level, it seems the most important factor influencing IJV strategy and success is institutions. We therefore suggest a greater use of institutional theory.

While disturbances injected along a coordinate corresponding to any individual player's actions can always affect the overall learning dynamics, a subset of players can be disturbance decoupled-i.e., such players' actions are completely unaffected by the injected disturbance. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions to guarantee this property for games with quadratic cost functions, which encompass quadratic one-shot continuous games, finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) dynamic games, and bilinear games. Specifically, disturbance decoupling is characterized by both algebraic and graph-theoretic conditions on the learning dynamics, the latter is obtained by constructing a game graph based on gradients of players' costs. For LQ games, we show that disturbance decoupling imposes constraints on the controllable and unobservable subspaces of players. For two player bilinear games, we show that disturbance decoupling within a player's action coordinates imposes constraints on the payoff matrices. Illustrative numerical examples are provided."

The soil samples of corn and barley grains were collected from seven agricultural zones and the concentrations of Cu, Fe, Pb, Zn and As were determined with the method of atomic absorption flame spectrophotometry. PERMANOVA showed that the effect of the type of crop and the sampling zone significantly influence the concentrations of heavy metals and As in soil and corn and barley grains (p < 0.05). PCA for heavy metals and As in soil and grain samples of the cereals studied showed that the first two main components represented 81.03% and 94.77% of the total variance, respectively. Hazard Quotient (HQ) for ingestion was the most significant. The HQ values of Pb and As in crop soils indicated that detrimental health effects are unlikely (HQ < 1). The soil hazard index (HI) values of both crops did not exceed the threshold value of 1 (HI < 1). The carcinogenic risk level (CR) of As from ingestion of corn and barley crop soils contaminated by As was higher in children than in farmers and adults. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) of As was higher in barley grains than in corn grains. The THQ of As exceeded the target value of 1 in 100% of the barley and corn sampling sites. The RC of As in grains exceeded the acceptable risk level of 10(-6) in all sampling zones."	"We express our gratitude to the Universidad Nacional del Centro del Peru for the financial support."

Methodology/approach: In order to study the meshes of relationships present in on-line social networks, the social constructionism approach was chosen. Distancing itself from the objectivist and subjectivist paroxysms of modern currents, social constructivism grants greater explanatory power to the formation of social networks because it is based on an intersubjective perspective. Main results: Actor's co-creation, and the ongoing interchange of information among them, provides to the social networks a polysemic and participative formation. However, it ends up promoting the emergence of an immanent consumption culture, conceding to marketing the function of the creation of social meanings and senses. Besides the distinction between the traditional physical consumption and the virtual one, an interaction model among social network actors is presented. Academic contributions: Based on the reflection on the interactions between the actors, a relational model for building virtual networks is suggested, which contributes to the literature by providing an integrated way of understanding the development of social media co-creation relationships based on the social constructivism. Practical contributions: New research agendas are suggested, showing that consumption in digital environments has marked differences in relation to traditional physical consumption. The continuous interaction between its actors guarantees the ubiquity of the digital co-creation process, bringing practical effects to the management of marketing and virtual consumption."

The obtained information is critical to provide an accurate characterization of energy consumption in order to avoid an overload of the electric system, and also to elaborate special tariffs to reduce the electricity cost for users. This article presents an approach for energy consumption disaggregation in households, based on detecting similar consumption patterns from previously recorded labelled datasets. The experimental evaluation of the proposed method is performed over four different problem instances that model real household scenarios using data from an energy consumption repository. Experimental results are compared with two built-in algorithms provided by the nilmtk framework (combinatorial optimization and factorial hidden Markov model). The proposed algorithm was able to achieve accurate results regarding standard prediction metrics. The accuracy was not affected in a significant manner by the presence of ambiguity between the energy consumption of different appliances or by the difference of consumption between training and test appliances."

Objective: to analyze fitness trends in Mexico in 2020 by means of the Worldwide Survey of Fitness Trends from ACSM; to contrast the results obtained for the year 2020 through the Worldwide Survey of Fitness Trends, the National Survey of Fitness Trends in Spain, and the China Survey of Fitness Trends. Methods: the present study is quantitative, non-experimental, descriptive and comparative cross-sectional. The population studied is composed by physical activity professionals and fitness instructors who live in Mexico. The sample is non-probabilistic; sampling was done via Google forms and distributed on social media (snowball). Results: Principal fitness trends for Mexico are: hiring professionals graduated in physical activity or related careers; functional training; exercise programs to lose weight; multidisciplinary work teams; and strength training. Compared to the survey, no concurrence was found in the top five. In the case of the national surveys in Spain and China, two concurrencies were detected. Conclusions: The study offers the possibility to know fitness trends for Mexico in 2020, to reflect about its evolution, and to delve into its study, so to be reference material to businessmen, entrepreneurs, and universities."

Based on this principle, this study characterized SMEs in the department of Cundinamarca, Colombia, using indicators to measure achievements in sustainable production. Descriptive, non-experimental field research was carried out. First, in order to identify indicators to be measured, a literature review was carried out by searching the Scopus, Emerald, ScienceDirect and Web of Science databases, within the 2009-2019 time window. A data collection instrument was constructed with 14 Likert-type questions. An intentional non-probabilistic sampling method was used which selected 105 companies. The instrument was validated by seven experts and was confirmed to be reliable by applying Cronbach's alpha. The results showed that SMEs must carry out structural transformations of their processes to be in harmony with social, environmental and economic systems, aspects that generally encompass sustainability. Additionally, clean production was found to be the element that requires the most work. Finally, the study showed that medium-sized enterprises are by and large more focused on sustainable production than small ones."
