"WOS:000545434900004"	""	""	"In this letter, we present a novel control scheme for feedback optimization. That is, we propose a discrete-time controller that can steer a physical plant to the solution of a constrained optimization problem without numerically solving the problem. Our controller can be interpreted as a discretization of a continuous-time projected gradient flow. Compared to other schemes used for feedback optimization, such as saddle-point schemes or inexact penalty methods, our control approach combines several desirable properties: it asymptotically enforces constraints on the plant steady-state outputs, and temporary constraint violations can be easily quantified. Our scheme requires only reduced model information in the form of steady-state input-output sensitivities of the plant. Further, global convergence is guaranteed even for non-convex problems. Finally, our controller is straightforward to tune, since the step-size is the only tuning parameter."

For this purpose, the main physicochemical composition of the RLK was first investigated. The proximate analysis shows that RLK has a relatively low moisture content, an absence of heavy metals, and the presence of an important amount of organic matter. In order to evaluate polysaccharides composition, RLK was dissolved in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide [Emim]Br ionic liquid; the resulting solutions are then immuno-labeled with monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs) against plant cell wall polysaccharides epitopes. Polysaccharides have been then analyzed using the ELISA technique with a set of 14 mAbs against hemicellulose and pectin. The LM19 immuno-labeling was more intense after 3 days of treatment at 80 degrees C, followed by 2 hours at 100 degrees C, indicating the important amount of un-esterified Homogalacturonans among RLK polysaccharides. Xray diffraction pattern indicates the presence of a small amount of crystalline cellulose. Surface functional groups and morphology of RLK were also investigated. RLK was then subjected to thermal analyses TG/DTG, DTA, and DSC under an inert atmosphere. The kinetic parameters were determined by the Coats-Redfern method. The highest activation energies were found in the first thermal degradation region where the main pyrolysis reaction took place, and the largest weight loss occurred, with energy values running from 24.34 to 117.06 KJ/mol"	""	"48"	"Univ Hafr Al Batin, Coll Sci, Dept Chem, Hafar al Batin, Saudi Arabia, Mohammed V Univ, Fac Sci, Phys Dept, Team Modeling & Simulat Mech & Energet, Rabat, Morocco, Mohammed V Univ, Fac Sci, Ctr Mat Sci, Lab Mat Nanotechnol & Environm,Dept Chem, Rabat, Morocco, Res Ctr Nat Sci, Inst Mat & Environm Chem, Magyar Tudosok Korutja 2, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary, Fac Sci & Tech, Lab Peirene, Equipe Sylva LIM EA 7500, F-87060 Limoges, France"	"Mohammed V Univ, Fac Sci, Ctr Mat Sci, Lab Mat Nanotechnol & Environm,Dept Chem, Rabat, Morocco"	""	"2021"	"APR 15 2021"	"11"	"2"	""	""	""	""	"9027"	"9043"	"17"	"BUCURESTI"	"BIOINTERFACE RESEARCH APPLIED CHEMISTRY, BUCURESTI, 00000, ROMANIA"	"BIOINTERFACE RESEARCH APPLIED CHEMISTRY"	"LOQUAT, TEMPERATURE, PYROLYSIS, RESIDUES, STARCH, PHASE"	""	""	""	""	"Article"	"1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7"	"1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7"	"Bentahar, Sarah 2| Costa, Guy 6| El Hamdaoui, Lahcen 3| El Marouani, Maryam 1| Kifani-Sahban, Fatima 7| Trif, Laszlo 4| Zerrouki, Rachida 5"	"Bentahar, Sarah 2| Costa, Guy 6| El Hamdaoui, Lahcen 3| El Marouani, Maryam 1| Kifani-Sahban, Fatima 7| Trif, Laszlo 4| Zerrouki, Rachida 5"	"1| 2| 4| 5| 6| 7| la.elhamdaoui@gmail.com 3"	"Eriobotrya Japonica Lindl.

The absence of research that addresses the teaching-learning process in handball from nonlinear pedagogy motivated the present work. The objective was to analyse the influence of certain task constraints: zonal defense of one line (LI1) and zonal defense of two lines with advanced defender (LI2), in the behaviour patterns, offensive and defensive ones, perfonned by handball players. These constraints, representative of the most used defensive handball systems, were applied in 16 small-sided games, during the eight sessions in which the study was developed. A nomothetic/punctual/monitoring observational design was used to register the behaviours performed by 14 players (M = 14.6 years and SD = 0.4), members of a team that competes in the male cadet category, who were divided into two groups for the matches. The analysis of polar coordinates allowed to know the influence exerted by both constraints at a general level, analyzing jointly the behaviors of both teams and, also, specifically for each team. Thus, significant relationships of mutual activation were found between: (1) LI1 and odd fixation, penetration throw, distance throw, block, opponent change, assist and counter block; and (2) between LI2 and uncheck, slip and intercept. Knowing the influence exerted by the task constraints (behaviors that facilitate and inhibit) is key in the application of non-linear pedagogy, in this way those that help to achieve the proposed objectives can be selected."

The study is relevant because it explores one of the effective ways to solve this issue - the introduction of physical folk games (PFG) in the educational system of the Republic of Kazakhstan. This will affect the physical development of schoolchildren and increase their involvement during physical education lessons. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of physical activities in traditional Kazakh physical games. For this, the types of Kazakh PFGs were studied, their classification was developed, a survey was conducted among schoolchildren to find out their interest in folk games. After that, an educational experiment was set up, during which the positive influence of PFG on the development of the physical skills of children at physical education lessons became evident. It was discovered that the indicators of physical mobility of schoolchildren significantly improved: the number of students with a low level of physical mobility (PM) decreased from 50% to 13%, and the average level of PM in schoolchildren increased from 31% to 62%. Due to the developments of this study, it is possible to continue work on the implementation of PFGs in the educational process, since this process is accessible. Physical folk games do not require complex equipment, expensive buildings, and special conditions. It is also important to study the impact of Kazakh PFGs not only on children with normal development but also on children with special educational needs."

Moreover, this analysis evaluates the level of implementation in this specific sector considering latest technological trends. The analysis was performed within the framework of the European project MAKING 4.0, where a complete set of surveys were launched to agents who were directly involved in the wood, furniture and manufacturing sector to find out what their impressions are about the current knowledge and the one demanded by the 14.0, obtaining results where the low level of competences and qualifications in this industrial sector is demonstrated, both in education and in industry, as well as the poor training offered in 14.0 and its KETs. It is concluded that there is an evident technological skills gap between those acquired by workers and by Vocational Education Training (VET) and HE students regards the demands of the 14.0, which must be covered within the next years, through training initiatives, enabling and acquisition of needed competences such as, for example, MAKING 4.0."

This hybridization incorporates the strength of both the algorithms for solving this variant. It works in two stages. In first stage, sine cosine algorithm is used to examine the unexplored solution space, and then in next stage, particle swarm optimization is used to exploit the search space. The proposed algorithm has been tested and compared with other algorithms on several benchmark instances.

The inhibition efficiency (IE) raised with increasing the cephalexin monohydrate drug dose but lowered with higher temperatures. The adsorption of the Cephalexin monohydrate drug established to follow Temkin isotherm. The PP tests designated that the cephalexin monohydrate drug is of mixed type. Synergism among iodide ion and cephalexin monohydrate drug was suggested. The outcome data gotten from the three altered tests were in excellent agreement.

These interactions are strongly influenced by the dimensions of interpersonal trust, namely benevolence, cognitive, and affective trust. A survey was conducted in the banking sector of Sokoto State, Nigeria. A questionnaire was administered to 500 bank customers from 10 commercial banks, in which the respondents were asked to select their preferences based on a five-point Likert scale. The data were analyzed using PLS-SEM version 3.2. The results showed that benevolence, cognitive, and affective trust positively influence customer interaction in the banking sector in Sokoto State, Nigeria. In financial transactions, benevolence trust, in the form of care and protection from harm by the bank staff; cognitive trust, manifesting as reliability, reputation, competence, and commitment of bank staff; and affective trust, in the form of attention, emotional connection, and empathy shown by bank staff positively influence customer interaction in a bank. Bank executives and policymakers can draw lessons from these results and create awareness within the banking sector on factors that contribute toward retaining and attracting new customers. This will contribute significantly to the growth and development of the banking sector."

Physical exercise is an alternative treatment that generates positive effects on patients' physical condition. Objective: To determine the effects of a physical exercise program developed through MOTOmed Viva 2 Parkinson system on lower limb strength and balance in people diagnosed with moderate to severe degree of Parkinson's disease. Method: A case study was conducted on four subjects diagnosed whit Parkinson's disease. They were treated with a 21-minute session of coordination exercises twice a week for seven weeks. Strength of lower limbs (30 Seconds Chair Stand Test) and balance (Timed Up and Go Test, 8 Foot Up and Go Test) were evaluated. Results: Dynamic balance showed improvements for three of the four patients. Strength of lower limbs showed mixed behavior, with observed improvements in one patient, worsening in another, and maintained levels in the remaining two. Conclusion: The coordinated physical exercise program (MOTOmed Viva 2 Parkinson) is presented as a useful treatment tool for people with moderate to severe Parkinson's disease."

We analyzed undergraduate programs through their location, nature of the university, denominations, justifications, and the basic core of knowledge and high-quality accreditation. As a result, we obtained that, since the end of the nineties, the offer of International Relations programs has increased considerably and this has allowed the institutionalization of the discipline, which has materialized in official decisions and the strengthening of an epistemic community. Likewise, we identify a notable centralization of International Relations training in the country's capital, as well as a concentration of its offerings in private universities and very few programs with high quality accreditation. Although this panorama reflects a disciplinary strengthening, there also persists a notable heterogeneity with respect to the conceptions that universities have about International Relations around its place in the social sciences (as part of Political Science, as an autonomous discipline or as a multidisciplinary project)"	""	"47"	"Univ Norte, Ciencias Sociales, Barranquilla, Colombia, Univ Norte, Relac Int, Barranquilla, Colombia, Univ Norte, Inst Altos Estudios Sociales & Culturales Amer La, Barranquilla, Colombia, Univ Autonoma Metropolitana UAM, Estudios Org, Mexico City, DF, Mexico, Corp Univ Costa, Educ, Barranquilla, Colombia, Corp Univ Amer, Medellin, Colombia, Univ Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia, Univ Los Andes, Estudios Int, Bogota, Colombia, Univ Norte, Ctr Pensamiento UNCaribe, Barranquilla, Colombia, Univ Los Andes, Ctr Espanol, Bogota, Colombia"	"Univ Norte, Ciencias Sociales, Barranquilla, Colombia"	""	"2021"	"JAN-JUN 2021"	""	"33"	""	""	""	""	"95"	"123"	"29"	"BOGOTA"	"CALLE 12, NO 1-17 ESTE, BOGOTA, 00000, COLOMBIA"	"UNIV EXTERNADO COLOMBIA, DEPT PUBLICACIONES"	""	""	""	""	""	"Article"	"1| 2| 3"	"0000-0001-7998-5137 1| 0000-0002-2917-3816 2| 0000-0002-3576-8533 3"	"Badilllo Sarmiento, Reynell 3| Guerra Molina, Rene Alonso 1| Virviescas Pena, John Anderson 2"	"Badilllo Sarmiento, Reynell 3| Guerra Molina, Rene Alonso 1| Virviescas Pena, John Anderson 2"	"jhonanvirpe@hotmail.com 2| ra.badillo@uniandes.edu.co 3| reneg@uninorte.edu.co 1"	"Institutionalization of international relations in colombia: approaching the consolidation of the discipline"	"OASIS-OBSERVATORIO DE ANALISIS DE LOS SISTEMAS INTERNACIONALES"	"OASIS-OBS ANAL SIST"	"OASIS-Obs.

We introduce the notion of disagreement interaction and we propose a distributed control design strategy that minimizes such potentially detrimental interaction between the agents. The above concepts are then specialized to a multi-agent system consisting of single integrators. The proposed solution does not introduce additional dynamics to the system anywhere in the network. It is shown that the minimization of the disagreement interaction results in the feature that the agents exchange the information strictly necessary to induce an endogenous internal model, while limiting any other interaction, which is not instrumental for reaching consensus and which may possibly induce instability of the interconnected network even in the presence of individually asymptotically stable agents."

The optical band gap decreases with the increase of the gamma-irradiation dose. Formations of unsaturation centers have been observed. FTIR observed that a lower dose of gamma-irradiation induces the formation of an unsaturated (-C=C-) group and a ketone carbonyl group. Breaking of the C-H bond is more frequent than the breaking of the C-C bond in irradiated HDPE Crosslinking dominates over chain scission (breaking of C-C bond of the main chain) at a lower dose (100 kGy).

There have been a little research addressing IoT platforms interoperability from business value perspective, considering technical and non-technical factors as selection criteria to adopt such platforms. This paper uses a case study as a method. To validate the suggested interoperability criteria, interviews were conducted for IoT platform providers and two things providers.

For a simple graph G = (V, E) with vertex set V and edge set E, a labeling phi: V boolean OR E -> {1, 2, ..., k} is called total k-labeling. The associated vertex weight of a vertex x is an element of V (G) under a total k-labeling 0 is defined as wt(x) = phi(x)+ Sigma(y is an element of N(x)) phi(xy) where N(x) is the set of neighbors of the vertex x. A total k-labeling is defined to be a vertex irregular total labeling of a graph G, if wt(x) not equal wt(y) holds for every two different vertices x and y of G. The minimum k for which a graph G has a vertex irregular total k-labeling is called the total vertex irregularity strength of G, tvs(G). In this paper, total vertex irregularity strength of interval graphs is studied. In particular, an efficient algorithm is designed to compute tvs of proper interval graphs and bounds of tvs are presented for interval graphs."

Our protocol is unbiased and robust with respect to the initial network state, but the knowledge of the algebraic connectivity is required. By means of the proposed control law, we design a local state feedback that achieves desynchronization on arbitrary undirected connected networks of diffusively coupled harmonic oscillators.

In embedding algorithm host image is splitted into reflectance and illumination components using HT, DWT is further applied to the reflectance component resulting in frequency subbands (HL and LH) which are transformed by SVD. Two image watermarks are selected for embedding process whereas security of proposed algorithm is strengthen by performing scrambling of second watermark through AT. Both watermarks are transformed with DWT and SVD. Singular values (SVs) of both transformed watermark are embedded into SVs of host image. Simulation results clearly signifies for high robustness and imperceptibility of proposed algorithm as it is examined under various attacks.

These conditions are prevalent in the Philippines, being a tropical country. Input parameters to the design process such as heat load, the height of the ceiling, comfort, and indoor air quality requirements were generated, and the main output parameters are the stratification height and ventilation airflow rate. To demonstrate the proposed displacement ventilation system, four cases were generated. Results show that the ventilation airflow rates obtained from the four cases were greater than the minimum outdoor air requirements for health in conference rooms and large assembly areas which are 17.5 and 3.5 liters/sec*person respectively, for smoking and no smoking rooms."

A better understanding of spine biomechanics could assist in developing protection devices to reduce injuries caused by caudocephalad acceleration (+Gz) in under-body blasts (UBB). Although some finite element (FE) human models have demonstrated reasonable lumbar spine biofidelity, they were either partial spine models or not validated for UBB-type loading modes at the lumbar functional spinal unit (FSU) level, thus limiting their ability to analyze UBB-associated occupant kinematics. Methods: An FE functional representation of the human spine with simplified geometry was developed to study the lumbar spine responses under +Gz loading. Fifty-seven load curves obtained from post mortem human subject experiments were used to optimize the model. Results: The model was cumulatively validated for compression, flexion, extension, and anterior-, posterior-, and lateral-shears of the lumbar spine and flexion and extension of the cervical spine. The thoracic spine was optimized for flexion and compression. The cumulative CORrelation and Analysis (CORA) rating for the lumbar spine was 0.766 and the cervical spine was 0.818; both surpassed the 0.7 objective goal. The model's element size was confirmed as converged. Conclusions: An FE functional representation of the human spine was developed for +Gz lumbar load analysis. The lumbar and cervical spines were demonstrated to be quantitatively biofidelic to the FSU level for multi-directional loading and bending typically experienced in +Gz loading, filling the capability gap in current models."

In Morocco, where groundwater withdrawals by farmers are very intensive and informal, maps describing and monitoring the extension of irrigated areas are scarce and labor-intensive to obtain. In this paper a novel transfer learning algorithm is proposed to map irrigated areas at different stages of an agricultural cycle from Landsat 8 images. The results obtained displays satisfactory performance over traditional machine learning algorithms.On a small dataset, we initially tested three well known deep learning architectures (SegNet, DenseNet and Unet). The results obtained were not satisfactory. So, to get high performance, we rely on a transfer learning architecture combining UNet with ResNet50 backbone (trained on 2012 ILSVRC ImageNet dataset) as a baseline after a phase where different configurations were tested.In the first part of this study, we compared the use of three optimization methods: Adam and two variants of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) associated with two techniques (Cyclical Learning Rate and Warm Restart) to find the optimal learning rate and then test the impact of data augmentation on the overall accuracies.Data augmentation had improved the overall accuracy for the three methods. Adam based method from 94% to 97% with mean IoU of 0,79 (for all land cover classes) and 0,86 for irrigated areas class. For SGD based methods, the overall accuracy had increased from 91% to 94% with mean IoU of 0,75 (for all land cover classes) and 0,82 for irrigated areas class. As we are interested in having irrigated areas maps at different key periods of the agricultural cycle, we also explored, in the second part of this study, the temporal generalization of the best model."

Drilling speed that is called the rate of penetration (ROP) in the drilling industry can be used as a good indicator for the performance evaluation of the drilling operation. Real-time control for drilling ROP is limited to just a few controllable parameters during drilling operations, that is, WOB, RPM, and hydraulics. These parameters can be controlled from the surface by the driller in real-time. In the traditional methods of ROP modeling, an inflexible equation could be developed between some important effective drilling parameters such as weight on the bit or bit rotational speed and drilling rate of penetration. These models had a low degree of accuracy, and they were not applicable in the newly drilled wells even in the same field with an acceptable degree of accuracy. In this study, a new real-time continues-learning method for ROP modeling was developed. In this method, as the drilling operation gets starts and the drilling data reaches the surface, ROP modeling starts, and as the drilling continues, the model accuracy increases. For the method evaluation, 5 famous existing analytical drilling model was selected. Also, a new ROP model was developed in this work. All of these 6 models contain some constant coefficients that were obtained using a new machine learning method named Rain Optimization Algorithm. In the end, the accuracy of the models was compared. Results show that the presented method for ROP modeling is a very flexible method with a high degree of accuracy that can be easily used in any formation. Also, the newly presented model could increase the accuracy of ROP prediction from 75% to 81%."

Therefore. the objectives of this study arc to understand the teaching-learning styles of the three educational agents (students, teachers and family members), and to analyse which factors influence the scores of the different teaching-learning styles of these three educational agents. To this end, the sample is composed of a total of 198 secondary school students from a high school in Castellon, 23 teachers who taught these students, and 104 parents of these students. The data were collected in all cases through questionnaires. The students preferred a theoretical style, and there were significant differences between the preference of styles according to gender, taste for Physical Education, and grades in this subject (p<.05). Younger teachers opt for an active teaching style, while older ones tend to use a more structured style, not influencing their work experience (p>.05). 49% of family members prefer a more reflexive style in the educational centers, finding a relationship between the tendency towards innovation and what they consider important in the classroom, with the different styles (p<.05). Therefore, the results point out the discordance in the teaching-learning process between the different educational agents. Therefore, the educational centers should know their own reality.

An appropriate age based overhaul maintenance policy for such systems can provide impetus to the operations. The paper proposes two different age based maintenance policies; Policy-I and Policy-II, to evaluate the overhaul time of an aero engine, where Policy-I considers MRS with imperfect corrective maintenance (CM), whereas Policy-II examines MRS with both imperfect CM and preventive maintenance (PM). The paper then provides a spare parts estimation model for both the policies. The developed policies and spares parts model are validated by considering field failure data of aero engines as a case and the obtained results are compared with the existing time based maintenance policy used for aero engines. The paper recommends the best policy to be used for MRS in general and the considered case in particular."

The objective was analyze the acute effect of an aerobic physical exercise session on selective attention in a sample of 48 boys and 40 girls (Age, M +/- DT = 9.48 +/- .505 years). A quasi-experimental study design with a control group and an experimental group was used. Physical exercise involves walking a mile as quickly as possible. Selective attention was measured with the Face Test. The experimental group was divided into two subgroups (minor v. major) according to the time spent in the mile. The results of the differences affected in correct answers (p = .012), inhibitory control (p = .020) and omissions (p = .007) after the intervention. An inverse correlation was detected between the time spent on physical exercise and correct answers (p = .022). The analysis of variance detected higher records in correct answers (p = .047) in the group with less time spent. The results suggest that performing a short duration aerobic exercise session could have positive acute effects on selective attention. Performing physical exercise like the mile in less time is related to better selective attention. A better aerobic capacity could be related to more selective attention."

However, the emotions of the students have enjoyed more prominence in the literature, compared to those of the teachers. The study of teachers' emotions is divided into two main approaches, one focused on intensity and the other on emotional quality. With the intention of contributing to the understanding of emotional quality, it has been decided to carry out a narrative review that aimed to analyze the meanings of the emotions of physical education teachers. The search was carried out in seven international databases and it was possible to identify seven qualitative investigations on the subject.

The problem is more controversial in electronic commerce and electronic marketing. Consumer behaviour is influenced by different factors and thus varies in different time periods. These dynamic impacts lead to the uncertain behaviour of consumers and therefore harden the target market determination. Real time decision making is a crucial task for obtaining competitive advantage. Decision Support Systems (DSSs) can be an appropriate process for taking real time decisions. DSSs are classified as information system based computational systems helping in decision making supporting business decision making and facilitate data collection and processing within market analysis. In this paper, different markets exist that are supplied by a producer. The producers need to find out which markets provide more profits for more marketing focuses. All consumers' transactions are recorded in databases as unstructured data. Then, neural network is employed for large amount of data processing. Outputs are inserted to an economic producer behaviour mathematical model and integrated with a proposed dynamic program to find the optimal chain of markets. The sensitivity analysis is performed using pricing concept. The applicability of the model is illustrated in a numerical example."

Currently is accepted that obesity is one of the major social and health problems worldwide and its prevalence is continuously increasing. Visceral fat is considered as a pathogenic factor in obesity. Objective. The main was to evaluate the effect of concurrent training on physical fitness in people with obesity, body composition and visceral fat area. Methods. 30 obese people participated in this study. They conducted an adapted and controlled concurrent training program during eight weeks. Physical fitness tests (muscular resistance, cardiorespiratory fitness, flexibility) and body composition measure were applied before and after the intervention period. Results. Improvement was observed on physical fitness variables. Muscle strength, both in the lower extremities (p = .001) and upper extremities (right arm p = .001 and left arm p = .002). Also, the walking speed (p = .001) and agility (p = .001) increased significantly. All body composition variables improved significantly. While fat mass, body weight, BMI and visceral fat area decreased considerably (p <.001), fat free mass and muscle mass increased significantly (p = .001). Conclusion.

In this work, a simple approach is proposed for assessing energy performance of livestock manure and mixed sewage sludge, as substrate by coupling the potential addition of several agro-food biowastes (co-substrate: fruit and vegetable biowastes, fish canning industry, other manures, coffee wastes, and non-edible crops). The results obtained showed an increase of energy performance indicator ranging from 30 to 250% and 62 to 539%, for livestock manure and mixed sewage sludge, respectively.

"WOS:000545569800005"	""	""	"This letter proposes a novel online active fault diagnosis (AFD) method based on invariant sets for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems with bounded disturbances and noises. In general, the system has the healthy mode and several faulty modes. During system operation, with respect to the healthy and faulty modes, the corresponding healthy and faulty output estimation sets are computed, respectively. Thus, the task of AFD can be converted to separate the healthy and faulty output estimation sets, which can consequently distinguish the current system mode and implement AFD. The existing AFD methods implement the objective by designing an input sequence to separate the healthy and faulty output estimation sets. However, it is difficult to use these methods to simultaneously combine AFD and fault-tolerant control. Thus, we propose a new AFD method in this letter to online design inputs step by step, which has potential to overcome some weakness of the existing AFD methods. Particularly, we implement this AFD objective by online designing inputs at each step to maximize the distances of the healthy and faulty output estimation sets. Moreover, this online input design problem can finally be transformed into the resolution of two mixed integer programming (MIP) problems with a similar structure. At the end, a quadruple-tank benchmark system is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with an existing set-based AFD method."

"WOS:000552941500003"	""	""	"This letter introduces the notion of linear time-varying (LTV) negative imaginary systems. LTV negative imaginary systems are defined using a time-domain dissipative supply rate w(u,(y) over dot) that depends on input to the system (u), time-derivative of the system's output ((y) over dot) and an index delta >= 0. For delta > 0, it gives rise to a strict subclass within the LTV negative imaginary systems, termed as LTV output strictly negative imaginary systems. For characterizing the proposed class of systems, a set of linear differential matrix inequality conditions is derived based on the given state-space realization. Subsequently, LTV negative imaginary theory is specialized to linear parameter-varying (LPV) cases for which, the differential matrix inequality conditions can easily be avoided by considering the rate of variation of the uncertain parameters as independent LMI variables. Finally, a set of sufficient conditions is derived which ensures that the origin is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point of an unforced positive feedback interconnection of two uniformly asymptotically stable LTV negative imaginary systems."

Managing complex data and obtaining accurate results from the analysis are essential functions of GIS. It is also efficiently used in highway designing both in project and application phases. This study proposes a new calculation method of slope angles to determine the suitable slope modal of a road by using topographic and geological datasets in a GIS environment. Using this method in the preparation phase of the project enables a more accurate calculation of earthwork volume. The proposed method was applied to a highway to prove this idea. The selected road is a significant tertiary of which project was completed by the Turkish General Directorate of Highways. In this study, the calculated values of the project were considered as references. Comparing both results obtained from the proposed method and application project, the accuracy of the slope modal of the proposed method is 71%, and the accuracy of its earthwork volume is 99%. The proposed approach will enable project managers and designers to determine more reliable earthwork volume during project feasibility studies without any application in the field."

First, manufacturing system for an automotive assembly line is modeled by adopting the methodology of two lines with an inter-line conveyor system. A quantitative analysis of an inter-line conveyor capacity is carried out under different conditions and capacities using discrete event simulation (DES). The initial results are obtained to justify the purpose of an inter-line conveyor followed by introducing a random failure of a station for the duration of 10 minutes, 30 minutes, and catastrophic breakdown of two hours at upstream and downstream line separately. The case study outcomes show that, 20 unit is an optimum capacity resulting in improved productivity. The findings of the different stoppage and catastrophic breakdown study show the buffering of an inter-line conveyor may serve as a new approach and guideline to the buffer stack design and scheduling maintenance."

"WOS:000588732800003"	"Yes"	"gold_doaj"	"Industry 4.0 is a modern approach that aims at enhancing the connectivity between the different stages of the production process and the requirements of consumers. This paper addresses a relevant problem for both Industry 4.0 and flow shop literature: the missing operations flow shop scheduling problem. In general, in order to reduce the computational effort required to solve flow shop scheduling problems only permutation schedules (PFS) are considered, i.e., the same job sequence is used for all the machines involved. However, considering only PFS is not a constraint that is based on the real-world conditions of the industrial environments, and it is only a simplification strategy used frequently in the literature. Moreover, non-permutation (NPFS) orderings may be used for most of the real flow shop systems, i.e., different job schedules can be used for different machines in the production line, since NPFS solutions usually outperform the PFS ones. In this work, a novel mathematical formulation to minimize total tardiness and a resolution method, which considers both PFS and (the more computationally expensive) NPFS solutions, are presented to solve the flow shop scheduling problem with missing operations. The solution approach has two stages. First, a Genetic Algorithm, which only considers PFS solutions, is applied to solve the scheduling problem. The resulting solution is then improved in the second stage by means of a Simulated Annealing algorithm that expands the search space by considering NPFS solutions. The experimental tests were performed on a set of instances considering varying proportions of missing operations, as it is usual in the Industry 4.0 production environment. The results show that NPFS solutions clearly outperform PFS solutions for this problem.

The mold is used for the production of thermosetting products by pressing technology. At present, the mold temperature is measured separately at sixteen locations of the mold. This measurement is lengthy and laborious, causing production downtime. At the same time, measurement is physically problematic since the mold has a temperature in the range of 130 to 150 degrees C. The controller must manually record all measured data in the record and re write the record to the computer. The new solution is to measure four control points at once. The controller will measure these points and the measured data will be sent online to the system. This method will clearly speed up the measurement process."

"WOS:000549258800013"	""	""	"In this letter we present a novel approach to continuous-discrete (CD) Kalman filtering. Unlike the EKF or other hybrid UKF-EKF filters, the novel approach does not require direct calculation of system Jacobians and instead uses unscented transforms (UTs) to extract a pair of matrices, each made up of a linear combination of derivatives (with respect to the state), that are used in its place. More specifically, they are used (1) in parts of the filtering process, and (2) in the linearly implicit numerical integration scheme of the filter's state propagation stage. Extracting these matrices from the filter's UTs and using them in both the filtering process and model simulation, or what we refer to as coupling the filter to model simulation, avoids having to calculate further function evaluations for standard implicit methods, making the process of state estimation for stiff systems more efficient. Another benefit of the proposed approach is that it offers UKF accuracy levels but improved numerical stability over the UKF. This is because it uses symmetric and positive-definite (PD) representations of the state covariance propagation and measurement update equations."

Forward invariance of a safe set is achieved through online parameter adaptation and data-driven model estimation. The new adaptive data-driven safety paradigm is merged with a recent adaptive controller for systems nominally contracting in closed-loop. This unification is more general than other safety controllers as contraction does not require the system be invertible or in a particular form. The method is tested on the pitch dynamics of an aircraft with uncertain nonlinear aerodynamics."	"This work was supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant 1122374.

The side effects caused by chemotherapeutic drugs have primarily led to the increased use of natural products for cancer treatment. Gaillardin, a medicinal herb, has been reported to have anti-proliferative effects on various cancer cells. In this study, cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of Gaillardin were investigated on acute promyelocytic leukemia cell lines, NB4. Different concentrations of Gaillardin were used to treat NB4 cells for 48 and 72 hours. Then cell viability was assessed using MTT assay. Flow cytometry was applied to the assessment of apoptosis by using Annexin V and Propidium iodide staining method. In order to determine the expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2, RT-PCR was carried out. Statistical data analysis was done by ANOVA (one-way). MTT assay results showed that Gaillardin concentrations of 7, 8, and 9 mu M would significantly reduce the percentage of live cells (P < 0.001)c. Flow cytometry results showed that Gaillardin significantly increased apoptotic cell percentage in comparison with the control groups (p < 0.05). Gaillardin can be considered as a candidate for further studies on the methods for treating various cancer types."

Previously acquired abdominopelvic and head studies were retrieved from a 3 Tesla scanner. Dicoogle tool was used for metadata indexing, mining, and extraction. Specifically weighted pulse sequences were related with weight, BMI, and gender through boxplot diagrams and effect size analysis. A decrease of SAR values with increasing body weight and BMI categories is observable for abdominopelvic studies. Head studies showed different trends regarding distinct pulse sequences; in addition, underage patients register higher SAR values compared to adults. Male individuals register marginally higher SAR values. Metadata recording practices and standardization need to be improved."

First, it discusses the role of festival director Robert Faure Le Bret in selecting and promoting Italian auteur cinema. Then it focuses on how the system of co-production between Italy and France impacted Fellini's work and the Festival's embrace of his films. Finally, it examines how the French press constructed the image of Fellini as an 'intellectual celebrity'. By grounding the analysis in documents from the Cinematheque Franfaise (French Film Archive), the Archivio Centrale dello Stato (Central State Archive) in Rome, and other primary sources from both Italy and France, this article provides a synergic view of the conditions for the emergence of Fellini's public image through the Cannes Film Festival."

We propose an identification method in the form of an optimization problem, minimizing the fitting error and guaranteeing the desired stability property. The problem is approached by joint identification of the dynamics and a Lyapunov function verifying the stability property. In this setting, the hypothesis set is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and with respect to each point of the given subset of the ROA, the Lie derivative inequality of the Lyapunov function imposes a constraint. The problem is a non-convex infinite-dimensional optimization with an infinite number of constraints. To obtain a tractable formulation, only a suitably designed finite subset of the constraints are considered. The resulting problem admits a solution in form of a linear combination of the sections of the kernel and its derivatives. An equivalent finite dimension optimization problem with a quadratic cost function subject to linear and bilinear constraints is derived. A suitable change of variable gives a convex reformulation of the problem. The method is demonstrated by several examples."

The analysis sheds light on how societal context, institutional arrangements, knowledge culture, and technology deployment manifest in national responses to the pandemic. Discussion describes country cases from East and South East Asia, on the one hand, and from Europe and Asia-Pacific, on the other. The overall impression is that Asian cases reflect proactivity and diligence, while Western responses are reactive and more often than not slightly delayed. Both country groups include successes, while the overwhelming majority of global benchmarks are Asian. As the management of COVID-19 crisis is essentially a multi-level governance issue, discussion about national strategies is supplemented with a glance at the role of cities.

By this work, it has been predicted a four electron dia-tropic (aromatic) ring current for (4n+2) pi variants of BnNnC(8-2n) H-8 and a two-electron-para-tropic (anti-aromatic) current for (4n) pi. With the HOMO and LUMO energies and also HOMO/LUMO overlapping in whole space, it is possible to predict the transition states from delocalized to-localized currents in all variant mentioned compounds in the viewpoint of aromaticity and anti-aromaticity. In addition, the nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS), HOMA, Ellipticity, Aromatic Fluctuation index (FLU), and para delocalization index (PDI) values confirm the amounts of aromaticity and anti-aromaticity in those rings."

The research design is testing the composition of fatty acids in repeated cooking oil using two types of treatment, namely cooking oil from frying without adding turmeric extract and cooking oil from frying with 0.03% turmeric extract added with 10 times frying repeat because it is suspected that repeated frying will increase the composition of fatty acids in cooking oil. The analysis of fatty acids was conducted using gas chromatography. Based on these results that the fatty acid components were produced of saturated fatty acids, namely lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid, whereas unsaturated fatty acids also detected such as elaidic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, cis-11-eicosadienoic acid, linolenic acid, and cis-11,14-eicosadienoic acid. The highest saturated fatty acid content in cooking oil before frying is palmitic acid (30.88%), whereas unsaturated fatty acid was oleic acid (35.86%).

The rapidly exponentially stabilizing control Lyapunov functions (RES-CLFs) developed for bipedal robots guarantee stability of the hybrid zero dynamics in the presence of impacts that occur in walking. These methods cannot be directly applied to prostheses because of the unknown human dynamics. We overcome this challenge with two RES-CLFs, one for the prosthesis subsystem and another for the remaining human system. Further, we outline a method to construct these RES-CLFs for this type of separable system by first constructing separable CLFs for partially feedback linearizable systems. This letter develops a class of separable subsystem controllers that rely only on local information but provide formal guarantees of stability for the full hybrid system with zero dynamics."

A qualitative methodology is followed, using content analysis as a method. Sampling was intentional and included eight textbooks of secondary education (freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior), which are in accordance with the current math curriculum in Chile. Results show that, in general, these textbooks do not use real data and do not mention the types of variability, whether natural, induced, or sample variability, to summarize information. In addition, contents are frequently approached in a procedural manner, which restricts teaching to using formulas and, in specific cases, to clarifying certain notations.There is no pedagogical use of computational tools like Excel or GeoGebra. The study evidenced textbook flaws to teach variability, including a lack of dear definitions and their role in statistics. Therefore, teachers should complement what has been indicated in the textbook with new readings and scientific articles on these topics, such as the introduction of appropriate methodologies to teaching statistics and probability, teaching through projects, and case studies with problematic situations in which this concept plays a fundamental role in the decision making."

The stability of the nanoparticle was achieved through the optimization of physico-chemical parameters. The sharp UV-visible absorption maximum at 400 was observed for biological synthesized silver nanoparticles. The spectroscopic analysis was thus used to assess the formation of silver nanoparticles. The AFM analysis did analyze the morphology of the nanocomposite, which was further confirmed through TEM micrograph. The electron micrograph image discloses that silver nanoparticles were polydispersed and dominantly as spherical with size ranges from 40nm to 100nm. The average size distribution was 49nm. The chemical reductions of Ag+ ions were further confirmed through FTIR. The biogenic silver nanoparticle and their drug formulation showed profound antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria. The flavonoids rich binding of silver nanoparticle showed great medicinal potential and can be used for the treatment of several harmful infectious diseases. Hence, plant-based metal nanoparticles meet the demand for less toxic formulation during drug development and its delivery."

However, existing literature has lacked recognition for consumer Halal cosmetic products. Therefore, this study enhances the body of knowledge about consumer attitude and intention to purchase Halal cosmetic products. Specifically, this article will discuss the moderating effect positioning has on attitude with purchase intention and subjective norms and purchase intention. While this study focuses on cosmetic products, it will also help to clarify situations of less favourable attitudes for Halal cosmetics compared to Halal food products. The study analyses a total of 359 valid questionnaires using partial least squares structural equation modelling. The analyses reveal that attitude and subjective norms have positive relationships with purchase intention for cosmetic products. This study confirms a significant relationship for baseline variables of Theory of Reason Action with consumer purchase intention. Product positioning is significantly prominent as a moderator in assessing the influence of attitude on consumer purchase intention. Halal cosmetic products have been well positioned in the market. In general, the findings provide a consumer perspective for Halal cosmetic product positioning that influences the purchase intention and moderates its relationship with attitude. Research limitations/implications - The study only focus on the consumers of Halal cosmetics by empirically validating the role of attitude and positioning on the prediction of purchase intention. Additionally, it proves the moderating role of positioning in the relationship between attitude and purchase intention. Thus, the perspective of consumers from other industries might provide different results. Practical implications - The study proves the importance of Halal positioning in influencing consumers attitudes towards Halal cosmetic products. Thus, marketing practitioners should leverage on a Halal positioning strategy to achieve competitive advantage."

Nicotine addiction is a disease dependent on the complex interactions of neurotransmitter pathways, conditioned behaviors, environmental cues, genetic predisposition, and personal life circumstances, which render some more susceptible to tobacco abuse than others. The most successful smoking cessation programs are individualized, comprehensive, and utilize combinations of clinician counseling, behavioral reinforcement, community resources, advanced technology support (eg, smartphone apps, and Internet Web sites), and pharmacotherapy (both nicotine-based and nonnicotine medications). E-cigarettes were introduced to the US market in 2006 and touted as a safer alternative to tobacco cigarette smoking. Unfortunately, over the last 5 to 10 years, recreational e-cigarette use, or vaping, has increased in popularity, especially among adolescents. This has introduced nicotine addiction to an entire generation of nonsmokers and resulted in numerous cases of acute lung disease, now known as e-cigarette or vape product use-associated lung injury (EVALI).

It was determined that 100% conversion of carbon monoxide was achieved at a temperature of 390 degrees C when using the copper-manganese-oxide catalyst (30% CuO + 70% MnO2). It was shown that although the use of the manganese-oxide catalyst provided 92.8% of CO conversion degree, this catalyst had the most advantages for application compared to the other studied solids. The structural parameters of the manganese-oxide catalyst were determined using XRD, SEM, and nitrogen adsorption. The composition of the main elements of the catalyst samples was determined by micro-X-ray spectral analysis. It was shown that using the catalyst containers in chambers heated by flue gases in the fire channels of a multi-chamber furnace for baking of electrode blanks can be one of the constructive solutions to the problem of flue gas purification from carbon monoxide. The environmental safety of the copper-manganese-oxide catalyst application for the treatment of the flue gases of electrode production is justified by obtaining a catalyst from spent sorbents for purification of the manganese-containing natural water and its non-toxicity in the case of burial or storage in landfills."

RNNs have excellent expressive power but lack the stability or robustness guarantees that are necessary for many applications. In this letter, we formulate convex sets of RNNs with stability and robustness guarantees. The guarantees are derived using incremental quadratic constraints and can ensure global exponential stability of all solutions, and bounds on incremental similar to 2 gain (the Lipschitz constant of the learned sequence-to-sequence mapping). Using an implicit model structure, we construct a parametrization of RNNs that is jointly convex in the model parameters and stability certificate. We prove that this model structure includes all previously-proposed convex sets of stable RNNs as special cases, and also includes all stable linear dynamical systems. Numerical experiments illustrate the utility of the proposed model class in the context of non-linear system identification."	"This work was supported by the Australian Research Council.

Furthermore, STL specifications can be encoded as cost functions using STL's robust semantics, transforming the synthesis problem into an optimization problem. Unfortunately, these cost functions are non-smooth and non-convex, and exact solutions using mixed-integer programming do not scale well. Recent work has focused on using smooth approximations of robustness, which enable faster gradient-based methods to find local maxima, at the expense of soundness and/or completeness. We propose a novel robustness approximation that is smooth everywhere, sound, and asymptotically complete. Our approach combines the benefits of existing approximations, while enabling an explicit tradeoff between conservativeness and completeness."

For this purpose, the opinions of current and potential users of sports centres have been analysed, asking them about the aspects mentioned above, offering a 5-point Likert type response scale. The results indicate that centre location, as well as the fact that the centre has personal trainers, guided activities and that it is multidisciplinary, are important elements for them. On the other hand, it is also observed that hygiene, the kindness of trainers, the equipment or the technological level of the centre, are the elements that motivate them when choosing a sports centre. Therefore, knowing the importance and motivation criteria, managers have useful information to be able to orient their marketing strategies more effectively, with the intention of adjusting to the demands and interests of users to a greater extent, improving the satisfaction of current users and increasing the probabilities of choice by potential users."

Although this descriptive and conceptualization work is essential, it is also necessary a comprehensive look at the relationship experience and the qualities that make it educational. That is the purpose of this text: to think holistically about the symbolic and physical place of the teacher in the educational relationship. This task is carried out through the notion of presence and thinking with the experience of two primary education students whom we have accompanied during two school years. Following the proposals of hermeneutic phenomenology, the research processes have been dose-observation and hermeneutic conversations. Based on this fieldwork, we began a dialogue with studies on presence, the pedagogy of presence and the narration of concrete experiences that we have lived with the students. We pretend that this dialogue allows us to glimpse some structural aspects of the educational relationship. Specifically, in the experiences we have studied we have identified three gestures that we name as: invite, be and leave. These gestures help us think about the qualities of the teaching profession and the educational relationship, anchored in the characteristics of this particular event and aware of its uniqueness, avoiding the temptation to try to generalize or extrapolate them to other educational relationships."

The fear of violence restricts women's participating in different social activities. So instead of becoming a victim of a violent crime such as domestic violence, robbery, or rape, women should call on resources to help her out of that situation. In this paper, the authors develop a women safety device, namely SafeWomen, which helps in reducing the crimes held against women. This is a new approach for providing security to women in any unsafe situation by sending an alert having geographical location along with emergency message to the registered contact numbers so that the incident could be prevented. Also, it can track the current location of the victim just by knowing the IP address of the device she is using. One can also use this system for the safety and security of kids and elderly people just by making some changes in the functionality of the system."
