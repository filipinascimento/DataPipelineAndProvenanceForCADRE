Methodology: field tests of agility 20 m zigzag, acceleration 10 m, speed 30 m, running based anaerobic sprint test (RAST), Yo-Yo IR1 and countermovement jump (CMJ) were applied, added to anthropometric measurements of height and body mass. Results: The results showed that the athletes in the youngest categories (Sub-13, Sub-14 and Sub-15) are higher than those reported in other scientific publications. In addition, 73.2% of athletes were born in the first two quarters of the selection year, revealing the effect of relative age. Categories Sub13 and Sub-14 presented the greatest number of differences when comparing their means in the different variants. Conclusion: The greater presence of objective tests allows us to determine the physical performance of young soccer players, this in turn allows us to create a more objective selection standard and with a lower margin of error for coaches."

The research was carried out mainly in the collections of the Instituto Historico e Geografico da Paraiba. After source survey and analysis, it emerged that the school of the first decades of the twentieth century was considered the first space of formation of the citizen, becoming a temple of hope and faith, with the mission of propagating useful knowledge to social life and shaping the moral personality of the student to the practice of the duties. In this context, there was a transition between the governments of Camilo de Holanda and Solon de Lucena, with the emblematic struggle being the implementation of the Public Instruction Reform (1917, as a modernizing proposal. Thereby, the primary teacher would be a missionary who, exercising a sacred ministry with affection and dedication, formed, beyond the intellect, the soul and heart of his pupils, enabling them to serve their homeland, family and society. Thus, it is concluded that the focus of education was to prepare the student to move actively and disciplinarily toward the future of a better society."

The objective was to determine predictive variables of healthy lifestyles and satisfaction with life in veteran athletes, according to the Self-determination Theory (SDT). A structural equation model and a mediation model has developed. The number of participants were 680 Portuguese veteran athletes, aged between 30 and 90 years old (M=43.78 DT=8.61). The Basic Psychological Needs Exercise Scale, the Behavioral Regulation in Sport Questionnaire, the Healthy Lifestyles Questionnaire and the Life Satisfaction Scale were used. This model has shown the following adjustments indices: divided by 2 = 729.116, p < .001, divided by 2/df = 4.41, CFI = .92; IFI = .92; TLI = .91; GFI = .91; RMSEA = .068; SRMR = .064. As a conclusion, in veteran athletes, the perception of satisfaction of the basic psychological needs for autonomy, leads to autonomously motivated behaviours, promoting better eating and resting habits, as well as high satisfaction with life, and a lower consumption of tobacco. Autonomous motivation has not proved to be a significant mediating variable between the basic psychological need for autonomy, lifestyles and satisfaction with life."

The main goals of the methodology are to assist not skilled in the art users about FMEA during the analysis of generic and specific features, by considering large moles of contributions in restricted amounts of time. The methodology has then been tested on the same pool of 286 documents, divided between 177 and 109 patents, manually analyzed in our previous survey, in order to replicate part of its classifications through the proposed new modality.

Oil extraction experiments were carried out with an Ateliers Afyach P55 mechanical screw press that had one press cylinder equipped with a heating ring located on the outlet side. Tested heating ring temperatures were 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, and 160 degrees C, and a medium screw rotational speed of 5 rpm was applied. The temperature was monitored during the extraction process along the cylinder and at the oil outlet. Results showed a significant effect of the cylinder heating ring temperature on the oil extraction yield; higher yields were obtained in the 80-120 degrees C range, with the highest values obtained at 80 degrees C for crude oil and clarified oil (53-55% and 47% wt/wt, respectively). At 60 degrees C, the oil extraction process was difficult to realize because the cylinder jammed due to the presence of a considerable amount of residue particles in the extracted oil. The measured temperatures at different points along the press cylinder during the extraction process and the temperature of the oil extracted during the process were much lower than the temperature of the heating ring. The extracted oil temperature ranged between 45 and 68 degrees C. In addition, even though the effects of the temperature on the monitored quality parameters (free acidity, peroxide value, and UV absorbance) were significant, all of the extracted oils were of extra virgin grade. These results imply that heating the ring of the extraction cylinder to approximately 80 degrees C optimizes the performance of the press and results in a high oil yield without compromising oil quality."

In this letter we present a method which, for a given multi-parametric quadratic program (mpQP) and any polyhedral set of parameters, determines which sequences of QPs will have to be solved when using outer proximal-point iterations. By knowing this sequence, bounds on the worst-case complexity of the method can be obtained, which is of importance in, for example, real-time model predictive control (MPC) applications. Moreover, we combine the proposed method with previous work on complexity certification for active-set methods to obtain a more detailed certification of the proximal-point method's complexity, namely the total number of inner iterations."

Static analysis of PZT patched cracked beam along with rotational spring is performed using Ritz method. Subsequently, a finite element analysis is performed by using ABAQUS 6.12 to collate the analytical results. It is shown in the study that when PZT patch is subjected to external electric field, it yields a local reactive moment, which counters the crack effects. An equation is procured in order to compute the required actuation voltage for repairing of cracks. A parametric study is performed for various boundary conditions and loading patterns.

In this sport, jumps and kicks are two techniques that require high values of explosive force and are also the most performed in competition. There is a relationship between plyometric training and sports perfonnance, as well as between muscular asymmetries and the increase in the probability of suffering an injury. The aim of this study was to test the effects of two plyometric training methodologies, monopodal versus bipodal, on the explosive strength values of the lower body and the correction of asymmetries in karatekas. 20 competitors of the kumite modality voluntarily participated in the research. The values of the explosive force were evaluated by means of the CMJ and horizontal jump test, and the asymmetries by means of Bishop's formula. Both training methodologies increased explosive force values and reduced asymmetries. Bipodal training was shown to be the most effective, predicting with an 80% probability an improvement in monopodal horizontal jumping with the non-dominant leg over monopodal training. Both trainings were shown to be effective in preventing injuries and improving performance."

Classifying a lesion precisely as Atypical Spitz Tumors or AST is challenging and often requires the integration of clinical, histological, and immunohistochemical features to differentiate AST from regular Spitz Nevus and malignant Spitz Melanomas. Specifically, this paper aims to test several artificial intelligence techniques so as to build a computer-aided diagnosis system. A proposed three-phase approach is being implemented. In Phase 1, collected data are preprocessed with an effective SMOTE-based method being implemented to treat the imbalance data problem. Then, a feature selection mechanism using genetic algorithm (GA) is applied in Phase 2. Finally, in Phase 3, a 10-fold cross-validation method is used to compare the performance of seven machine-learning algorithms for classification. Results obtained with SMOTE-Multilayer Perceptron with GA-based 14 features show the highest classification accuracy, specificity (0.98), and a sensitivity of 0.99."

Our algorithm is based on projected pseudo-gradient dynamics, augmented with consensual terms. Under strong monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity of the game mapping, we provide a simple proof of linear convergence, based on a contractivity property of the iterates. Compared to similar solutions proposed in literature, we also allow for time-varying communication and derive tighter bounds on the step sizes that ensure convergence. In fact, in our numerical simulations, our algorithm outperforms the existing gradient-based methods, when the step sizes are set to their theoretical upper bounds. Finally, to relax the assumptions on the network structure, we propose a different pseudo-gradient algorithm, which is guaranteed to converge on time-varying balanced directed graphs."

The latter ones are essentially represented by chromatin remodeling factors as transcriptional control of gene expression at the nucleus level. Certain sets of tumor suppression genes controlling vital cell functions such as cell cycle, DNA repair, cell adhesion, and apoptosis are considered candidate genes for defining specific types of cancer. Their silencing may be achieved through somatic mutations or by epigenetic factors as DNA methylation and histone covalent modification. Two major DNA methylation patterns have been described in mammary gland tumors: genome hypomethylation and concomitant in situ hypermethylation in critical genes. Human mammary gland cancer has been studied through animal models, canine one offering opportunity to investigate the molecular aspects that better define the borderline between the primary inflammatory and tumor progression processes. In contrast, both humans and dogs share the same challenging environment. This work presents the preliminary results in a study of the transcriptional epigenetic markers identified in canine mammary glands during tumor development. Bisulfite mutagenesis based methylation-specific (MS)- PCR has been performed for the estimation of BRCA1, and BRCA2 gene promoter hyper-methylation profiles, concomitant to methylation sensible restriction of genomic DNA in order to estimate the global hypo-methylation status have been performed on 9 DNA samples obtained from clinically selected canine tumor tissues. Histone H3K9 trimethylated was stained by immunohistochemical methods (IHC) in normal and tumor tissues. The results are discussed through their crosstalk with DNA methylation dynamics in order to highlight the cancer initiation and progression processes in the context of heritability and the causes of sporadic cases."

The research is underpinned by a critique of the spiral model of human rights change and second wave normative scholarship. The study focuses on quantifying contextual, independent (online behaviours), and dependent (legal change) variables in order to model the effectiveness of the campaigns. Using the space of social media presents a wide range of opportunities as well as threats. It may be that these campaigns are indeed leading to the change sought after by domestic women and girls, and that, as many posit, the weight of the international attention leads to positive outcomes. Equally, it may be that the campaigns are ineffective or, worse, lead to harmful government backlashes. This research seeks to understand these outcomes in depth, using empirical data to model the effectiveness of campaigns. This article in particular focusses on the methodological challenges and solutions with this kind of large-scale comparative social media research."

In addition to the logistics planning issues, the reasons for the occurrence of the fire disasters should also be determined so that measures may be put in place to prevent future disasters as well as any potential consequences that may occur after the fire is extinguished. Most cities have efficient fire departments quipped with resources and fire brigades to initiate immediate measures to control the fire and to start the rescue operation. Moreover, most governments take steps to provide relief and rehabilitation assistance to the affected population. Rescue, relief, and rehabilitation steps in traffic-congested cities, especially in heavily populated areas with many businesses and markets, are highly challenging. This research proposes a mathematical modeling-based approach for planning the transportation of relief and rescue resources; conducting relief and rescue operations; and outlining measures to prevent future recurrences.

It explored their frequency of Facebook use as well as the impact of gender, age, and employment status on Afghan youths' political participation and engagement in the 2019 presidential elections on Facebook. An online survey questionnaire was used to collect data. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 26.0. Descriptive statistics, T-test, and One-Way ANOVA test were employed to answer the research questions. The findings showed that Afghan youths did not actively participate in political activities on Facebook although they spent at least half an hour on Facebook every day. They were engaged in low-cost and low-risk political activities, e.g., following Afghan politicians. Likewise, their engagement in the 2019 presidential elections was superficial; they were engaged in electoral activities on Facebook that required low efforts and commitment, e.g., following presidential candidates. Moreover, the gender, age, and employment status of the participants did not have any significant impact on their frequency of Facebook use, political participation, and engagement in the 2019 presidential elections on Facebook."

Crowd counting or density estimation is an extremely challenging task in computer vision, due to large scale variations and dense scene. Current methods solve these issues by compounding multi-scale Convolutional Neural Network with different receptive fields. In this paper, a novel end-to-end architecture based on Multi-Scale Adversarial Convolutional Neural Network (MSA-CNN) is proposed to generate crowd density and estimate the amount of crowd. Firstly, a multi-scale network is used to extract the globally relevant features in the crowd image, and then fractionally-strided convolutional layers are designed for up-sampling the output to recover the loss of crucial details caused by the earlier max pooling layers. An adversarial loss is directly employed to shrink the estimated value into the realistic subspace to reduce the blurring effect of density estimation. Joint training is performed in an end-to-end fashion using a combination of Adversarial loss and Euclidean loss. The two losses are integrated via a joint training scheme to improve density estimation performance. We conduct some extensive experiments on available datasets to show the significant improvements and supremacy of the proposed approach over the available state-of-the-art approaches."

Trihedral corner reflectors are also included in the analyses because of their importance in data calibration. Polarimetric backscattering signatures of different targets are analyzed in terms of qualitat ive assessment of amplitude images and identification and classification of scattering mechanisms through target decomposition techniques. The findings of these analyses and detailed discussions are presented. Specifically, the entropy/mean-alpha ((H/(alpha) over bar)) classification results are shown to be capable of clearly identifying the dominant scattering mechanisms occurring within the investigated scene."

Diversity is understood as the variety of options that a public space offers to the users, giving them the opportunity to choose the area which best suits their needs, activities, and personal preferences. The method facilitates an environmental quality assessment and comparative evaluation between spaces. Decision support tools based on data analysis are developed to facilitate technical urban design decisions. The methodology is based on a multi-criteria analysis of a public square in Madrid, Spain. Field measurements of climatic data and thermal properties of materials, the activities carried out by people and their location, as well as factors related to urban design are collated in the analysis. Data are complimented with bioclimatic and simulation tools. The analysis identifies differentiated thermal profiles, as well as patterns of use of the space. This enables the identification of specific locations currently favored by citizens and the microclimatic and spatial variety of the square."

The proposed kernel has a similar structure to the one of the first order spline kernel. By exploiting the known properties of such kernel, the determinant and the inverse of the Gram matrix of the proposed kernel are given in closed form. One of the important advantages of the proposed kernel is the computational burden reduction. In fact, it turns out that the complexity is linear in the dataset size N, while standard methods require O(n(2)) memory and O(n(3)) flops, where n is the impulse response length usually satisfying N << n(2) in regularization frameworks."

Optimal heat supply and heat production capacities in the area are estimated by using hourly linear optimisation model for two separate model years and for normal and low district heating temperature cases. Results indicate that disintegration from district heating supply inflict 12-24% higher annualised total costs. However, completely removing the areal district heating network increases total costs considerably. Solution for heat supply in building area is a package consisting of ground source heat pump, heat storage and photovoltaics panel. Centralised ground source heat pump with centralised heat storage completes the heat supply cost-efficiently with low district heating supply levels. Solar collectors and exhaust air heat pumps are not cost-efficient solutions due to high investment costs."

Efficacy of the proposed scheme is verified through simulation study with first-order plus dead time (FOPDT), second-order plus dead time (SOPDT), and pure integrating plus dead time (IPDT) processes in comparison with recently reported PID tuning relations. Robustness of the proposed controller is also tested in presence of perturbation for process model parameters. In addition, Kharitonov's interval polynomial is used for robust stability analysis.

The distinctions which are discussed are between; upbringing, schooling and education; aristocratic versus democratic principle of education; aristocratic versus democratic conception of nature; and, culture as static versus culture as praxis. Equality is highlighted in the paper as a central concept for democracy as well as education and are discussed through Jacques Ranciere. The distinctions established will also make clear what is at stake if we consider educational thought as conditional for democracy and a liveable life for anyone. The contrast between the aristocratic principle and the democratic principle for education will centre on conceptions of violence and nonviolence, in accordance with Judith Butler and Franco Bifo Berardi's analyses. In a final paragraph the paper discusses how equality play out in relation to teaching, and the discussion is extended by exploring Judith Butler's conception of 'grievability'. The paper concludes by suggesting that education is the ethical-political potentiality of a new beginning within the present order of things, and therefore the very praxis of change of this order. and therefore what makes paideia possible in the first place."

But who are they spying for? Could we imagine a smart toy that is programmed to pick up concerns raised by the child about their treatment by parents or guardian and alert the authorities? Could they be used to positive effect, therefore? It will be argued that this is a complex and contested area and there are clear contradictions in law, particularly concerning the protection of a child's right to privacy versus parental expectations. This article therefore challenges some of the narratives around this area. The article will also ask whether the smart toy offers an opportunity to recast the notion of a child's right to privacy in a way that balances children's autonomy rights with their protection rights. It is often the unintended use of technology that shifts its purpose from villain to guardian and back again, and the smart toy may be another example of this."

Therefore, we present a systematic review of the literature concerning the current situation of ethnoichthyological studies in Brazil. We examine the temporal and spatial citation trends in Brazil, as well as who are the research actors and the thematic areas covered in the articles. In all, 177 published articles related to the topic were found in Brazil. The number of published articles increased significantly in time, with most studies concentrated in the Northeast Region of the country (44.4%), especially in the state of Bahia (16.8%). The types of aquatic environments include both marine and freshwater, such as sea (46.3%) and rivers (70.2%). The articles mainly rely on the collaboration of artisanal fisherman (74.3%). The topic most frequently addressed in the studies was bio-ecological aspects of fish (33.8%). On the other hand, studies on morphological aspects (2.7%) represented the less frequently among the thematic areas. We concluded that ethnoichthyology is increasing significantly in Brazil. However, some issues needed to be better understand, especially the knowledge of the recreational fishermen, the morphological aspects of the fish species by local fishermen and there are few studies in South and Midwest in Brazil, which will indicate the future efforts to improve the species conservation and the resource management."

In applications, along with the point that minimizes sum-of-distances, it is important to know the points in the convex sets at which the minimum sum-of-distances is achieved. Various formulations existing in literature do not involve finding the optimal points in the convex sets. In this letter, we formulate a non-smooth convex optimization problem, with both the point/set of points which yields the minimum sum-of-distances as well as the corresponding points in the convex sets as primal variables. We term this problem as extended FTP (eFTP). We adopt non-smooth projected primal-dual dynamical approach to solve this problem. The proposed dynamical system can exhibit a continuum of equilibria. Hence we show semistability of the set of optimal points, which is the pertinent notion of stability for such systems. A distributed implementation of the primal-dual dynamical system is also presented in this letter. Four illustrative examples are considered for the simulation based validation of the solution proposed for eFTP."

We consider systems that can switch among a finite set of transition matrices, which we call the modes. Our analysis is focused on two properties: 1) almost sure convergence to an absorbing state under any switching, and 2) almost sure convergence to a desired set of absorbing states via a proper switching policy. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions based on the structures of the transition graphs of modes. More specifically, we show that a switching policy that ensures almost sure convergence to a desired set of absorbing states from any initial state exists if and only if those absorbing states are reachable from any state on the union of simplified transition graphs. We then show three sufficient conditions for absorption under arbitrary switching. While the first two conditions depend on the acyclicity (weak acyclicity) of the union (intersection) of simplified transition graphs, the third condition is based on the distances of each state to the absorbing states in all the modes. These graph theoretic conditions can verify the stability and stabilizability of absorbing states based only on the feasibility of transitions in each mode."

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is applied as a rapid and specific method for the detection of contaminants in beer manufacturing. The PCR protocols were effective for the detection of yeasts in beers during processing until packaging. The presence of wild yeasts and molds during processing could be risky and will affect the final product quality. The predominant contaminants of non-alcoholic beer were found to be the species of Saccharomyces, Pichia, Rhodotorula, Alternaria, Hansenia, Wickerhamomyces, and Cladosporium.

The sample consisted of 184 students from two educational centers aged between 12 and 18 years, of which 104 students (56.5%) belonged to middle school, whereas 80 (43.5%) belonged to high school. Sex distribution was 53.8% (n = 99) boys and 46.2% (n = 85) girls. The instrument used was a questionnaire to analyze participation in physical education classes. For the statistical analysis, non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon U) were used, the effect size was calculated and, to determine if there were associations between the different dimensions, Pearson's correlation coefficient was used.

"WOS:000548754100011"	""	""	"For sequential betting games, Kelly's theory, aimed at maximization of the logarithmic growth of one's account value, involves optimization of the so-called betting fraction K. In this letter, we extend the classical formulation to allow for temporal correlation among bets. To demonstrate the potential of this new paradigm, for simplicity of exposition, we mainly address the case of a coin-flipping game with even-money payoff. To this end, we solve a problem with memory depth m. By this, we mean that the outcomes of coin flips are no longer assumed to be i.i.d. random variables. Instead, the probability of heads on flip k depends on previous flips k-1, k-2,..., k-m. For the simplest case of n flips, with m = 1, we obtain a closed form solution K-n for the optimal betting fraction. This generalizes the classical result for the memoryless case. That is, instead of fraction K* = 2p-1 which pervades the literature for a coin with probability of heads p >= 1/2, our new fraction K-n depends on both n and the parameters associated with the temporal correlation. Generalizations of these results for m > 1 and numerical simulations are also included. Finally, we indicate how the theory extends to time-varying feedback and alternative payoff distributions."

The present study gathers the views of university students studying a Bachelor's Degree relating to Physical Activity and Sports Sciences at public universities in Spain and United Kingdom (UK). Focus is placed on the training received relating to students with SEND. The data came from a questionnaire completed by 457 students from both countries who were in their last year of Bachelor's Degree. The results show that the quality of training in SEND is the factor that most influences self-perceptions about scientific and professional capacity to address disability and SEN. Furthermore, personal experience in SEND matters also show an important influence and, to a lesser extent, although also significantly, the predominance of practical training over theoretical knowledge. The percentage of students who declare that their Bachelor's Degree gives high importance to training in SEND is higher in the sample of UK students. In addition, significant differences have been found over the three components detected, demonstrating that Spanish students, unlike UK students, perceive that their level of professional training is higher, despite there being a greater need for training, and that the preparation of teachers for integration is also greater. Results suggest the necessity to continue focusing efforts on improving training in the field of SEND, providing it with higher levels of inclusiveness, both in its theoretical and practical content. This is something that should also be applied to continuous training offered by official educational institutions addressed to non-university teachers."

The article aims to bring a feminist focus to Fellini's circus figures and discusses with the increasingly popularity of female clowns within the contemporary neo-burlesque scene. The central question posed by this article is whether these burlesque clowns can transform Fellini's most famous clown Gelsomina - fragile, tragic and asexual - into a powerful and sexy female clown.

Sulforaphane, an active ingredient from cruciferous plants, has been identified as a potential anticancer agent in various cancers. However, there is little information about its effect on cervical cancer. Here, we conducted a present study to uncover the effect and the potential mechanisms of sulforaphane on cervical cancer. HeLa cells were treated with sulforaphane, and cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8, Western blot, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence. Then, next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics tools were used to analyze mRNA-seq, miRNA-seq, and potential pathways. Finally, qRT-PCR, Cell Counting Kit-8, flow cytometry, small RNAs analysis, and Western blot were performed to evaluate the biological function of miR1247-3p and MAPK pathway in HeLa cell lines. Sulforaphane significantly suppressed the viability and induced apoptosis of HeLa cells. NGS and bioinformatics analysis showed sulforaphane exerted its anti-tumor activities through miR1247-3p and the MAPK signaling pathway. Further analysis suggested that sulforaphane could activate MAPK pathway via down-regulating the expression of miR-1247-3p. Sulforaphane inhibited proliferation and promoted apoptosis of HeLa cells via down-regulation of miR-1247-3p and activating the MAPK pathway. These findings provide preliminary experimental evidence for the treatment of cervical cancer with sulforaphane."

Fromm contributed a fundamental humanist perspective to contemporary thought and his work was characterized by weaving together various cultural influences, such as the Old Testament, Buddhism, Marxism, Sociology and, of course, Psychoanalysis. The main objective of the present work is to specify how this relationship could be better understood, considering its main characteristics. The work of this emblematic author invites to reflect on various aspects related to education ranging from its concept, its purposes, as well as to different characteristics of a g(x)d educational relationship, a subject that we will address in this article. Fromm brings a singular and extremely interesting perspective that opens spaces for reflection from various aspects of human existence in his texts. In this study we have analyzed twelve of his books ranging from Escape from Freedom (1941), The art of loving (1956) or The art of listening (1995). This analysis has allowed selecting those contents linked with the educational relationship. Then we will focus on what Fromm understands by education and after specify what would be the most essential questions in an optimal educational relationship, and what should characterize it."

Computation offloading may give a prominent solution. But it relies on the connection to the remote cloud and may fail in situations where there is poor or no connectivity. Cloudlet was introduced to cover this problem, but mobile users miss free mobility when using cloudlets. Offloading to the cloud or cloudlet is not always the preferred solution. An alternative is to utilize the nearby mobile devices as local resource suppliers and pull their capabilities as a mobile device cloud. In this paper, the authors present such an approach known as ad hoc computing as a service (AhCaaS) model for computation offloading in an ad hoc manner by connecting to nearby mobile devices. They define a multi-attribute selection strategy to determine the optimal computation offloadee. They evaluated the proposed model, and the result shows that AhCaaS reduces execution time, battery consumption, and avoids task reassignment."

However, although governance as a concept has been used vigorously in the discursive strategies of the doctrines of New Public Management (NPM) in conjunction with discourses of innovation as a justifying purpose; it is also possible to trace discourses that can be grouped in a framework called Post-New Public Management (P-NGP) which proposes new conceptions about governance and innovation; Conceptions that articulate a shift in the ways of conceiving and understanding organizational forms, public management and the State itself in its interaction with society."
