"WOS:000545435100002"	""	""	"This letter considers a sensor attack and fault detection problem for linear cyber-physical systems, which are subject to system noise that can obey an unknown light-tailed distribution. We propose a new threshold-based detection mechanism that employs the Wasserstein metric, and which guarantees system performance with high confidence with a finite number of measurements. The proposed detector may generate false alarms with a rate Delta in normal operation, where Delta can be tuned to be arbitrarily small by means of a benchmark distribution. Thus, the proposed detector is sensitive to sensor attacks and faults which have a statistical behavior that is different from that of the system noise. We quantify the impact of stealthy attacks on open-loop stable systems-which perturb the system operation while producing false alarms consistent with the natural system noise-via a probabilistic reachable set. Tractable implementation is enabled via a linear optimization to compute the detection measure and a semidefinite program to bound the reachable set."

The constraint here is an elliptic partial differential equation with Neumann boundary conditions. The discretization of the optimality system produces a block coupled algebraic system of equations of saddle point form. The solution of such systems is a major computational task since they require specialized methods. Constructing robust, fast and efficient solvers for their numerical solution has preoccupied the computational science community for decades and various approaches have been developed. The approaches involve solving simultaneously for all the unknowns using a coupled block system, the segregated approach where a reduced system is solved and the approach of reducing to a fixed point form. Here the minimum residual solver with ideal preconditioning is applied to the unreduced 3 by 3 and reduced 2 by 2 coupled systems and compared to the multigrid method applied to the compact fixed-point form. The two methods are compared numerically in terms of iterative counts and computational times. The numerical results indicate that the two methods produce similar outcomes and the multigrid solver becoming very competitive in terms of the iterative counts though slower than preconditioned minimum residual solver in terms of computational times. For all the approaches, the two methods exhibited mesh and parameter independent convergence. The optimal performance of the two methods is verified computationally and theoretically."

The concentrations of enzymes for hydrolysis were 1% and 6% based on enzyme/substrate [E/S] ratio. The bioactivity of the hydrolysates as an antioxidant was measured based on their capacity to inhibit 1,1-diphenyl-2-picylhydrazyl (DPPH). The ascorbic acid or vitamin C in the range 50-150 ppm was used as positive controls. The result showed that the bioactivities of all hydrolysates were increased compared to gelatin before hydrolysis. The hydrolysates have a percent of inhibition range that higher than the ascorbic acid. The hydrolysates of gelatin derived from the bone of Pangasius sutchi would be a potential source as raw material for bioactive peptides production with antioxidant activity."

Hypopressive exercise helps reducing intrathoracic, abdominal, as well as pelvic pressure, thus helping to improve the tone of the pelvic floor and abdominal muscles, and eventually reducing abdominal perimeter. The goal of this study is to describe the effects of an eight-week hypoppressive exercise program on a group of healthy women from the Western Valles Region of Barcelona during 2016-17. A single-group pre-post test approach was used. The program consisted of two 30-minute hypopressive training sessions per week, over the eight-week duration of the program. Abdominal perimeter was reduced on an average of 3.48 cm while Peak Flow was increased up to an average of 40 l/min. Sustained hypopressive exercise over 8 weeks (significantly) reduces abdominal perimeter and improves muscle tone and Peak Flow, therefore increasing trainees' breathing/respiratory capacity."

This limitation could not be ignored as it may affect the subsequent analysis and modeling of the data. Hence, this gap needs to be improved by filling the spatial gap in the satellite datasets. In this research, Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) is applied to fill the spatial gap and has successfully worked in the reconstruction of missing data of chlorophyll-a for monitoring harmful algal blooms (HABs) in Sepanggar Bay located at coastal water of Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia. The original chlorophyll-a pixels are used to assess the accuracy of the predicted data. Then, the DINEOF model is compared with the Spatio-temporal Kriging model for validation purposes. The results obtained show that the DINEOF model has the highest Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.9940 and the smallest values of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) which are 0.2770 and 0.0155 respectively. Therefore, this proved that the DINEOF model is more effective for filling spatial long gaps."

Computational Thinking, programming, and robotics have been integrated into the schools' curriculum in many countries. Accordingly, it is essential to analyze the teachers' preparation to teach these thematic trends. A descriptive and exploratory quantitative approach was implemented with 49 participants. The results pointed out a positive level of interest, educational robotics knowledge, problem-solving, self-confidence of both pre-service and in-service teachers. It was possible to identify significant correlations in all dimensions, in particular, between Self-confidence and Educational Robotics Knowledge, and Problem-solving and Interest. Therefore, it is necessary to promote these dimensions, in an integrated way, in the pre-service and in-service training programs through learning activities with robotics."

Applying the instrumental analytical methodology, satisfactory results were obtained for the environment, since both metals (cadmium and lead) were absorbed by these species. In this context, the following conclusions were obtained: a) The concentration of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) in drained waters of the Tangana mine were 0.2661 mg Cd / l and 25.7220 mg Pb / l, the quantification of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) concentration in the cattail species was 0.0007 mg Cd / Kg and 0.0037mg Pb / Kg, the quantification of the concentration of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) in the putacca species was 0.0020 mg Cd / Kg and 0.0948 mg Pb / Kg). From the above it is inferred that putacca has a higher absorbance than cattail. b) Collaborative learning with the complement of ICTs allows students of different educational levels to reduce the gaps in access to information and interaction with experts in the field."

By knowing where and/or when physical problems may arise in athletes, we can try to prevent them from appearing through strategies such as the modification of training plans and/or workout intensity, the preventive treatment of possible future injuries, etc. In this paper a systematic literature review was carried out to establish if the use of mathematical models for prediction of injuries is a valid method to be used in sports practice as a preventive measure. It is concluded that the logistic regression equations developed to date do not have in consideration all the variables that influence the appearance of injuries, such as psychological variables and external factors that affect the athlete's vulnerability. Therefore, it is proposed to make new formulas that include more causal factors of these, in addition to the creation of computer applications that apply these equations in order to facilitate the work of the sports specialist."

The analysis of these states could be the initial step in a process to first predict and later allow individuals to control these states. To this end, the authors begin to build a system for dynamic brain state analysis using EEG data. The system allows users to transit EEG data to an online database through mobile devices, interact with the web server through web interface, and get feedback from EEG data analysis programs on real-time bases. The models perform self-adjusting based on the data sets available in the database. Experimental results obtained from various machine-learning algorithms indicate great potential in recognizing user's brain state with high accuracy.

Furthermore, the present study has categorized financial development into the banking sector and stock market development to explore their effects separately. For this purpose, two indicators have been chosen for the banking sector and two for stock market development. Conversely, as expected the sign of inflation is negative with in-significant effect. Lastly, this paper uses various diagnostic tests to check the various econometric issues in the given models. In sum, based on the findings this research recommends that by improving the quality of the governance and by increasing the remittances long-term economic growth is possible in Pakistan. In addition, financial development is also an important determinant of growth in Pakistan.

The authors propose in this paper to apply the variable neighborhood search (VNS) metaheuristic on the problem of brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) segmentation. In fact, by reviewing the literature, they notice that when the number of classes increases the computational time of the exhaustive methods grows exponentially with the number of required classes. That's why they exploit the VNS algorithm to optimize two maximizing thresholding functions which are the between-class variance (the Otsu's function) and the entropy thresholding (the Kapur's function). Thus, two versions of the VNS metaheuristic are respectively obtained: the VNS-Otsu and the VNS-Kapur. These two novel proposed thresholding methods are tested on a set of benchmark brain MRI to show their robustness and proficiency."

To maximize the region of operation, we also construct as large as possible safe initial sets that can be safely steered into the safe terminal set in finite time. We use scalable reachability analysis and convex optimization to efficiently compute safe sets of sampled-data systems. These systems are composed of a physical plant evolving in continuous time and a digital controller being implemented in discrete time.

Deep soil mixing (DSM) is one of the widely accepted methods for improving soft soil properties like increase in bearing capacity and reduction in settlement that are of utmost importance for the construction of any structure. In this study, ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS)-based geopolymer was used to investigate its efficiency as a sustainable replacement to cement for DSM applications, thereby reducing the carbon footprint. A total of 27 GGBS-geopolymer mixes and 9 cement-treated reference mixes were cast and tested for strength and durability characteristics. The variables of the study include binder content (10, 20, and 30%), activator/binder ratio (0.5, 0.75, and 1.0), and initial soil moisture content (0.75w(L), w(L), 1.25w(L)). Different tests were conducted to explore the properties of stabilised clays, such as unconfined compressive strength, flexural strength, and durability against wetting drying cycles. To meet the requirements of DSM application, binder dosage greater than 10% and A/B ratio greater than 0.5 were recommended. With an increase in initial soil moisture content, the strength of the treated specimens under unconfined compression and flexure reduced and thus increased binder dosage helps to meet the DSM requirements for high water content soils. From the present study, it can be concluded that using slag-geopolymer binder for stabilising soft soil is an effective and sustainable alternative to cement in DSM applications."

Brazil has the second biggest international audience of the league in the world, and part of it is engaged to social networks during game broadcasts. Methodology: The study adopts the netnographic approach as research method, which was based on monitoring Twitter hashtags launched by ESPN channels in Brazil during three seasons, between 2016 and 2019. Results: Our findings reveal three practices of acculturation: comparison between Brazilian and American features, the embodiment of American rituals and routine changes to adjust to the schedule of the league. Theoretical contributions: This research contributes to marketing literature by showing how fan's interaction on social networks about massively mediated entertainment objects (i.e., media sports) can incorporate and resonate in an acculturation process. Practical contributions: Marketing professionals can look at fannish (i.e., prosumerist) interactions to achieve opportunities and competitive advantages based on reliable information acquired on social networks."

Despite being a simple concept, sampling presents researchers with many challenges. Generally, due to monetary and time constraints, researchers must take a smaller sample size than they would ideally use. Using statistics from these small samples, estimates for population parameters can be made, typically in the form of a confidence interval. However, the validity of these confidence intervals depends on three basic assumptions that are difficult to meet with small sample sizes. This paper traces the development of the sampling method known as bootstrapping that helps small samples to meet these assumptions. The paper touches on previous methods used before the development of bootstrapping and shows how bootstrapping has evolved over the last four decades and become widely used in the field of statistics."

Detailed comparison between the global optimum solutions obtained from two PSO variants and the effect of swarm size is studied. The performance of IW-PSO and CS-PSO are studied by observing the convergence behavior of the respective algorithms with respect to iteration count. The influence of velocity clamping on the optimized solution is investigated and its use is found beneficial as it prevents the solution from overflying the region with global best solution.

The motivation and the learning environment, within education, both of them depend a lot on the educational methodologies that are implemented in educational centers. The objective of this work is to compare the motivation and the state of Flow between the Flipped Classroom methodological strategy and a traditional methodology. For this reason, a quasi-experimental design study was carried out, with a selection of the non-probabilistic and intentional sample. 103 university students participated in the study, divided into an experimental group (Flipped Classroom) and a control group (traditional methodology). The motivation and the state of Flow were evaluated before the beginning of the lessons related to the subject: Physical Education Didactics and at the end of it (four months later). The 2x2 achievement goal questionnaires (Guan et al., 2006) and DREEM (Herrera et al., 2015) were used. To determine if there are initial and final differences between the groups, the T-Student test was performed on independent samples. To observe intra-group differences (pre vs. post-test), a T-Student test was detected for related samples. The results found that there are differences between the control group and the experimental group in the variables approach/mastery (p <.001), teaching (p =.003) and learning (p =.05). With the Flipped Classroom methodology, students have higher levels of motivation and Flow status than students who teach a traditional methodology."

A total of 26 young soccer players were analyzed during 18 competitive matches (n=108). High-intensity acceleration efforts were assessed using an individual relative threshold based on the capacity of acceleration from different initial speeds, considering high-intensity acceleration when it was >75% of the maximal acceleration (>75% a(max)). It was also used a threshold >21 km.h(-1) when the acceleration intensity was >75% a., and absolute thresholds of >3m.s(-2) and >4 m.s(-2), both in number and distance (meters). Post hoc analysis showed pairwise significant differences between the use of high-intensity thresholds (p < .05), in number and distance. The results showed that the use of absolute thresholds could overestimate (>3 m.s(-2)) and underestimate (>4 m.s(-2) and >21 km.h(-1)) high-intensity acceleration efforts (both in number and distance) in comparison with the use of an individual relative threshold (p < .05), whereas a threshold based on high-speed running could underestimate high-intensity acceleration efforts (p < .05). Therefore we conclude that the use of absolute acceleration thresholds (>3 m.s(-2) and >4 m.s(-2)) may not be appropriate to analyze these efforts in young soccer players. In addition, speed running thresholds could underestimate high-intensity actions developed in short distance, being more appropriate to combine with an individual relative threshold to assess high-intensity action in soccer matches."

Drawing from the Global Innovation Index input-output framework we developed an alternative longitudinal index. The resulting country scores were used to construct a panel dataset composed of the 19 Eurozone members during the period 2013-2018, which were analysed through a series of multiple regression techniques. Results suggest a strong and positive influence of Business Sophistication on innovation outputs in Eurozone countries, derived mainly from the capacity of domestic firms to absorb knowledge. Possible implications for Spain could be derived from this fact, such as, for instance, encouraging inward foreign direct investment. Future research is needed to analyse the differentiated effects of such encouragement, as well as other surprising results of our study."

There was an upward trend in the apparent permeation coefficient (Papp) of ketoprofen with the decrease in pH to a value close to pKa. At the pH value below pKa the permeation coefficient had lower value, due to the higher retention of ketoprofen in the artificial membrane. Metformin is a low permeable compound, and the highest permeation values were recorded at pH 7.4. Two dissociation constants determine that metformin at physiological pH exists as a hydrophilic cationic molecule, i.e. predominantly in ionized form. At pH values below 2.8, metformin mainly exists in diprotonated form, and it was, thus, very poorly permeable. The highest retention, i.e. affinity of both ketoprofen and metformin to the membrane, was at the lowest pH values, which is explained by different mechanisms. At higher pH values of donor compartment the substances showed significantly less affinity to the membrane. The obtained values of apparent permeation coefficients at studied pH values showed good correlation with the obtained experimental values by other in vitro methods. (c) 2021 by the authors.

The elemental composition and structure of the composite and the cadmium loaded sorbent were characterized using EDX, FTIR and SEM. Variables affecting cadmium removal such as initial metal ion concentration, contact time and pH were investigated by batch experiment. Maximum adsorption capacity of 8220 mg kg(-1) was obtained at optimal pH 5 with percentage removal efficiency of 99.30% for 4480 ppm initial metal ion dosage. The data simulated using the adsorption and kinetic models were fitted well in the Freundlich isotherm implicating multilayer adsorption-chemisorption process and pseudo-second-order kinetic as the rate limiting steps. Critical examination of the adsorption mechanism showed that inner-sphere complexation, ion exchange, co-precipitation and electrostatic attraction are the main driving force in the mechanistic interaction of the Schiff base N2O2 surface functionalized nanocomposite biochar with cadmium. The new nanocomposite is of low cost, benign, effective and efficient for the removal of cadmium in comparison with industrial sorbents and other functionalized biomaterials, and highly recommended for decontamination of cadmium polluted sites."

In this letter, we first describe a cross-layer model for CPS to explicitly capture the coupling between control and networking and the time-sensitive requirements of each physical system. Physical systems processes are coupled via a shared network that provides a diverse range of cost-prone and capacity-limited services with distinct latency characteristics. Service prices are given such that low latency services incur higher communication cost, and prices remain fixed over a constant period of time but will be adjusted by the network for the future time periods. Physical systems decide to use specific services over each time interval depending on the service prices and their own time sensitivity requirements. Considering the service availability, the network coordinates resource allocation such that physical systems are serviced the closest to their preferences. Performance of individual systems are measured by an expected quadratic cost and we formulate a social optimization problem subject to time-sensitive requirements of the physical systems and the network constraints. From the formulated social optimization problem, we derive the joint optimal time-sensitive control and service allocation policies."

"WOS:000595588400005"	""	""	"Due to increasing urbanization, the distribution of human settlements is changing and this has led to the rapid decline of vegetation cover in cities and townships. Urbanization tends to decrease the proportion of land that is dedicated to public green spaces. Therefore, residential gardens (private gardens) will need to play a major role in contributing to urban green space in future though presently little attention is given to their relative value and importance. Several factors influence the function of residential gardens in an urban area. The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the socio demographic factors that influence the size and presence of residential green spaces in an urban residential zone. As a case study, this research selected a primary residential zone in Galle City, Sri Lanka. Every housing unit (n=280) in a residential zone was surveyed to collect the data for multiple regression analysis. The analysis showed that factors such as land extent (LE), nature orientation (NO), perceptions about advantages of growing residential greenery (PA), perception about disadvantages resulting from residential garden (PDA), occupational status (husband and wife are not occupied) (D-1), and their educational level (higher than degree) (D-2) significantly affect to the extent of green area maintained by an urban residence. The relationship between extent of residential green space (EGA) and socio demographic factors can be explained by this model: EGA = 0.091 + 0.003LE + 0.060NO + 0.030PA - 0.040PDA + 0.198D1 + 0.240D2."

In Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, fishers introduced juveniles of peacock bass Cichla kelberi in the Juturnalba Reservoir in the 1990's. In the last years, this fish started to be caught in the Sac Joao River, downstream of the dam. This study aimed to identify whether fishers recognize the potential impact of the peacock bass over the native species, to understand the economic valuation they made to the services provided by this species, and if they include management of the non-native peacock bass in their practices. Semi-structured interviews with artisanal and sport fishers were employed between September and October 2016. A total of twenty-five interviews were carried out, 12 with artisanal and 13 with sport fishers. In general, fishers expressed knowledge about biological and behavioral aspects of the peacock bass, but opinions diverged on its impact over the native ichthyofauna. Differently from the artisanal, most sport fishers do not relate the decline in populations of native species to the occurrence of the peacock bass. Instead, they mention other anthropogenic impacts in the river basin. The later advocate the practice of fish and release in order to maintain a sustainable population of peacock bass in the study area. The ethnoichthyological knowledge gathered from fishers provide novel information of the native ichthyofauna, peacock bass introduction and other anthropogenic impacts, and might constitute a powerful tool to the development of sustainable strategies of the natural resources."

A third-party logistics (3PL) company supports the logistics between the manufacturer and the buyer, by transporting the products from the manufacturer to a warehouse and then delivering the products in a smaller quantity to the buyer. The proposed solution procedure determines the number of deliveries per cycle, delivery interval, and delivery quantity between the 3PL and the buyer simultaneously.

The construction of educational bets in the local scope through service-learning allows to overcome the development of concrete and isolated experiences and to advance towards the construction of educational networks that have a horizon of common good. The contributions in this sense are based on qualitative experiential research that has combined the documentary analysis of different previous experiences and the action-research process carried out in three Catalan territories (Barcelona, Sant Cugat and Puig-Reig). This text sets out the main lines of action to be developed from the perspective of facilitation and/or coordination in the process of implementing service-learning at a territorial level: approach to the territory, shared diagnosis; generation of projects; and communication of the territorial commitment. The reflection on this process underlines that all of them are based on principles such as openness, recognition, coherence and sustainability, among others. Likewise, the work also points out some reflections about the educational agency by other agents of the territory, beyond the educational centers, and the strengthening of the network work to generate more educational territories."

This is achieved through transforming the finite-horizon minimum time-energy problem with input constraints to an approximate infinite-horizon optimal control problem. To achieve collision avoidance, we incorporate artificial potential fields into the approximate cost function. We develop an IRL-based optimal control strategy and prove its convergence.

This study proposes to analyze the phytosociological aspects of the Caatinga domain under anthropic disturbance and their correlations with hydrological variables. Twenty-five 400 m(2) plots were sampled in the municipality of Floresta - PE, Brazil. Phytosociological parameters such as density, frequency and dominance were calculated. The seasonality of plant area index was analyzed for six species. The association between structural characteristics and hydrological variables (throughfall, stemflow and interception loss) in the species was evaluated by multivariate analysis. A total of 930 individuals, six families and 10 species were recorded. The abundance of the species Cenostigma pyramidale in the area may be an indicator of the degree of change in the vegetation.

Several quantum chemical parameters have been computed to interpret the inhibition activity of 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, o-phenylenediamine, and hydrazine hydrate. The ranking of the quantum chemical calculations classifies 2, 4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine as high efficient inhibitor among the studied molecules. The correspondence of the lowest energy gap (Delta E = 4.27 eV) for the calculated value (88.9%) of the highest inhibition efficiency (%IE) of 2, 4 Dinitrophenylhydrazine. Therefore, in parallel, the experimental inhibition of aluminum corrosion was tested using amine compounds in 1M hydrochloric acid solution by means of gravimetry and gasometry measurements. These compounds have been found to act as effective corrosion inhibitors for aluminum in the acid solution, and the best one was 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, represent one of the salient agreements between experimental and theoretical measurements. The data are showing that this inhibitor is appropriate for Langmuir adsorption isotherm. SEM micrographs indicate that the surface coverage increases in the presence of 0.5 mM of 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazine inhibitor, which in turn results in the formation of the adsorbed compound on the metal surface and the surface is covered by an inhibitor layer that effectively controls the dissolution of aluminum"	""	"42"	"Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ IMSIU, Coll Sci, Dept Phys, Riyadh 11623, Saudi Arabia, South Valley Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Qena 83523, Egypt, Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ IMSIU, Coll Sci, Dept Chem, Riyadh 11623, Saudi Arabia, Minist Justice, Mansoura Lab, Dept Tox & Narcot Drug, Forens Med,Medicolegal Org, Cairo, Egypt"	"Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic Univ IMSIU, Coll Sci, Dept Chem, Riyadh 11623, Saudi Arabia"	""	"2021"	"APR 15 2021"	"11"	"2"	""	""	""	""	"9772"	"9785"	"14"	"BUCURESTI"	"BIOINTERFACE RESEARCH APPLIED CHEMISTRY, BUCURESTI, 00000, ROMANIA"	"BIOINTERFACE RESEARCH APPLIED CHEMISTRY"	"MILD-STEEL CORROSION, ADSORPTION PROPERTIES, HCL SOLUTION, QUANTUM, DERIVATIVES, DENSITY, DFT"	""	""	""	""	"Article"	"1| 2| 3"	"1| 2| 3"	"Abou-Krisha, Mortaga 2| Hussein, Rageh K. 1| Yousef, Tarek A. 3"	"Abou-Krisha, Mortaga 2| Hussein, Rageh K. 1| Yousef, Tarek A. 3"	"m_abou_krisha@yahoo.com 2| rahussein@imamu.edu.sa 1| tayousef@imamu.edu.sa 3"	"Theoretical and Experimental Studies of Different Amine Compounds as Corrosion Inhibitors for Aluminum in Hydrochloric Acid"	"BIOINTERFACE RESEARCH IN APPLIED CHEMISTRY"	"BIOINTERFACE RES APP"	"Biointerface Res.

Five effective parameters in HS-SDME process, including extraction solvent volume, sample content, extraction time, extraction temperature, and agitation speed were screened and subsequently optimized using fractional factorial screening methodology (FFSM) and response surface methodology using Box-Behnken design (BBD). The extraction was carried out with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as micro drop, with 1 mu l of extraction phase injected into the GC-FID system. The calibration curve for the analytes was found to be linear within the range of 0.05-10.00 mu g g(-1), and the limits of detection for methanol and ethanol were 0.02 mu g g(-1) and 0.03 mu g g(-1), respectively. The relative standard deviation obtained within 1.8-5.2% and a good recovery achieved within the range of 95.0-102.6% in the analysis of oil samples revealed that methanol and ethanol could be determined as a chemical marker of the transformer life using this method."

The resulting catechol derivative aggregates silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs). The resulting product was characterized by different characterization techniques including UV-Vis spectrometry and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The SA-CAT induced aggregated Ag-NPs were used to develop a fast and ready to use colorimetric detection method for fluoride ion in water. In the presence of fluoride ions, the color of aggregated Ag-NPs solution changes from red to yellow with an absorbance decrease at 508 nm and an increase at 397 nm. Under the optimized conditions, the ratio of the absorbance intensity at 508 nm and 397 nm (A(397)/A(508)) was proportional to the fluoride ion concentration in the range of 1-40 mu M with a detection limit of 0.2 mu M.

They are used in solving a variety of problems, such as goal-seeking and obstacle avoidance. Hamilton-Jacobi analysis provides a method for solving reach-avoid problems, through a corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation. Although the HJ equation can be utilized for a general class of problems, computing the solution of the HJ equation by grid-based methods has exponential complexity in the dimension of the continuous state. To alleviate this complexity, this letter presents a generalized version of the Hopf-Lax formula and proves its correctness for solving the reach-avoid problem. The method does not rely on discretization of the state space. A numerical algorithm for the proposed Hopf-Lax formula is presented, and demonstrated using a 12D vehicle example."

This letter presents two strategies to design control laws for discrete-time switched linear systems, whilst guaranteeing asymptotic stability of the closed loop. Firstly, an arbitrary switching signal is considered. In this scenario a common quadratic Lyapunov function is used for stability, but subsystem Lyapunov functions are employed to improve local subsystem performance. Secondly, a constrained switching signal, associated with subsystem lower dwell time bounds is studied. In this case, a decrease in Lyapunov cost is achieved by design, based on dwell time constraints only, thus removing the need for both a common quadratic Lyapunov function or direct stable switches. It is shown in both cases that the control design problems can be formulated as one or a sequence of semi-definite programming problems, and therefore can be solved efficiently. Finally, two examples are provided in order to illustrate the different techniques presented."

Despite extensive studies on both opinion dynamics and appraisal dynamics separately, no previous work has ever combined these two processes together. In this letter, we propose a novel and intuitive model on the interplay between homophily-based appraisal dynamics and influence-based opinion dynamics. We assume that individuals' opinions are updated via the influence network constructed from their interpersonal appraisals, which are in turn updated based on the individual opinions via the homophily mechanism. By theoretical analysis, we characterize the set of equilibria and some transient behavior of our model. Moreover, we establish the equivalence among the convergence of the appraisal network to social balance, the modulus consensus of individual opinions, and the non-vanishing appraisals. Monte Carlo validations further show that the non-vanishing appraisals condition holds for generic initial conditions. Compared with previous works that explain the emergence of social balance via person-to-person homophily mechanism, our model provides an alternative explanation in terms of the person-to-entity homophily mechanism. In addition, our model also describes how individuals' opinions on multiple irrelevant issues become correlated and converge to modulus consensus over time-varying influence networks."

The optimal controllers are designed for both finite-time stability and asymptotic stability of PBCNs. In order to verify the convergence of the proposed QL algorithm, the obtained optimal policy is compared with the optimal solutions of model-based techniques, namely value iteration (VI) and semi-tensor product (STP) methods.

These experiments are used to improve the achieved performance and to reduce the uncertainty about the unknown parts of the system. This is achieved through a parametrization of auspicious controllers with convex relaxation techniques from robust control, which guarantees that their implementation on the unknown plant is safe. This approach permits to systematically incorporate available prior knowledge about the system by employing the framework of linear fractional representations."

The main reason is the translational invariance of convolution in time and space. Thereby the diversity of the sound signal can be overcome. However, in terms of sound direction recognition, there are also problems such as a microphone matrix being too large, and feature selection. This paper proposes a sound direction recognition using a simulated human head with microphones at both ears. Theoretically, the two microphones cannot distinguish the front and rear directions. However, we use the original data of the two channels as the input of the convolutional neural network, and the resolution effect can reach more than 0.9. For comparison, we also chose the delay feature (GCC) for sound direction recognition. Finally, we also conducted experiments that used probability distributions to identify more directions."

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ARB in infectious virus diseases. We searched up to March 2020 in MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), for studies investigating ARB in virus infectious diseases. Descriptive analysis was made on the main results of the eligible articles that meet the inclusion criteria. Fifty-two studies were included finally, which involving influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronaviruses (SARS-CoV), middle east respiratory syndrome-coronaviruses (MERS-CoV), hepatitis c virus (HCV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), severe acute respiratory syndromes-coronaviruses-2 (SARS-CoV-2), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), hantaan virus (HTNV), zika virus (ZIKV), coxsackievirus, lassa virus(LASV), Ebola virus (EBOV) and adenovirus (ADV). ARB is effective in the above viruses. Two studies showed that ARB was effective in SARS-CoV-2. In vivo and in vitro studies showed ARB had the capability of inhibiting SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCV, HSV, ZIKV, CV, HTNV, ZIKV, CHIKV, LASV, EBOV, and ADV.

The advent of recent drug-targeted therapies undoubtedly is going to reduce the incidence of cancer over the coming years. However, the frequency of occurrence of such chronic diseases like cancer would continue to increase. Therefore, the search for a safer and cost-effective treatment is urgently needed. Phytochemicals found in plants, foods, vegetables, tea, etc. have emerged as proven therapeutic compounds modulating signaling pathways involved in cancer. We carried out a structured search of bibliographic databases for peer-reviewed research literature using the keywords: cancer chemoprevention, flavonoids, dietary polyphenols, terpenoids, bioactive, microbiota. Quality of the retrieved papers and characteristic outcomes of the articles included in the study was assessed by employing standard tools and deductive qualitative content analysis methodology. The development of personalized supplements comprising particular phytochemicals has been the key, especially dealing with chronic inflammatory disorders like cancer. Better understanding at the molecular level explains the influence of phytochemicals on human health, which has been extensively covered through this review. Moreover, the wide collection of dietary polyphenols that has significant properties in reference to human health has been highlighted. Furthermore, the etiology of end products of such phytochemicals, especially on the modulation of gut microbiota and the host-microbial interactions thereof, need to be properly understood. The present study summarizes the chemoprevention and treatment of cancer using the bioactive components, including flavonoids, dietary polyphenols, and terpenoids. Likewise, the effect of dietary polyphenols on the human gut microbiota has been realized more recently. However, more research is needed in this field, especially focused on the communications, interlinks between the gut microbiota and polyphenols with the precise mechanism of action."

For this reason, a systematic review of the scientific literature addressing the effects of PA on the cognitive functions (CF) of older people has been conducted. Four databases were consulted to locate relevant literature: Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct and Pub Med, and the Scholar Google search engine. After applying the selection criteria, 31 articles were left, which were analyzed in terms of a) country, number of individuals and age, b) variables, and c) research approach, duration and results. In general, PA improves several dimensions of cognitive functions of older people, where genetic and environmental factors that have to do with the individual's lifestyle are mediated. Types of PA behave differently in terms of the dimension of cognitive function they improve. The determination of biochemical markers (BDNF, dopamine, amyloid peptide a, gamma gap), nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMR) and changes in the electrical activity of the brain support the hypothesis that PA produces changes in brain shape and activity, without significant changes in behavior observed and measurable by standardized tests of mental health."

Short-term change has taken hold of everyday life, and people who do not cope with it become obsolete. Under this scenario, the life and work of the university graduates became fickle since their near future grows in uncertainty. Thus, we aimed to shed light on human optimization pathways from Higher Education in the knowledge-based society and economy, which made possible a new industry. In this line, we conducted an analysis underpinned by critical hermeneutics from educational policy proposals, research findings, and analytical philosophy. After analyzing the context, the person, and the learning needs, we offered a clearer idea of the universities 4.0, where the `learning to learn' meta-competence appears to be a key factor for working and living well. This meta-competence may lead to enable human optimization and overcome human obsolescence in a way in which people be increasingly valuable to invest their values in their communities. This paper includes some guidelines for Higher Education institutions to enhance organization and curriculum, according to the new model of society and the human conditions.
