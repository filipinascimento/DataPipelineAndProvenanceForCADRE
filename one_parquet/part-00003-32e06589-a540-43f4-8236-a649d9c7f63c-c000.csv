In contrast to standard binary criteria, the proposed measures allow to quantify these properties numerically. An optimization based approach for calculating these measures is derived. Meaningful conditions for such measures are introduced and the properties of the proposed measures regarding these conditions are analyzed. In order to demonstrate their usefulness, the measures are applied to optimal sensor placement for reconstruction of unknown forces on a mechanical structure."

Despite its subjectivity, it could be related to the lateral accelerations on horizontal curves. This study aimed to analyze the relationship between passengers' comfort and lateral acceleration in two-lane rural mountain roads. Real-vehicle experiments were performed with 58 passengers on one road in the Ecuadorian Andes. They explored the influence of age, sex, level of stress, level of physical pain, speed and lateral acceleration on passenger comfort. Two instruments were employed to collect data: a survey conducted to the passengers and a precise GPS device. In the survey, the passengers selected their comfort or discomfort within the curve. The GPS collected the vehicle speed, lateral accelerations and its trajectory. As a result, it calibrated two models using Structural Equation Modeling (SEMI with the factors: comfort values, stress level and lateral acceleration. Besides, it calibrated six models using linear regression with several thresholds of speed. Differences were found between right and left curves, which had not been detected by previous researchers. The research suggests thresholds of lateral acceleration in mountain roads in a Latin American country that would improve their design for better performance and safety."

The High Dynamic Range (HDR) technique captures the same objects or scene for multiple times in different exposure and produces the images with proper illumination. This technique is used in the various applications such as medical imaging and observing the skylight, etc. HDR imaging techniques usually have the issue of lower efficiency due to capturing of multiple photos. In this paper, an efficient method is proposed for HDR imaging technique to achieve better performance and lower noise. The Luminance-Chrominance-Gradient High Dynamic Range (LCGHDR) method is proposed to obtain the proper luminous value of images. The same scenario is captured at different exposure are processed by the proposed method. Based on these feature values extracted from the different images and exposure fusion technique was developed that helps for the proper imaging. This experiment was evaluated and analyzed by comparing with the other methods, which showed the efficiency of the proposed method.

This paper proposes an approach for code clone detection using dynamic time warping technique (i.e., DTW). DTW is a well-known algorithm for aligning and measuring similarity of time series and it has been found effective in many domains where similarity plays an important role such as speech and gesture recognition. The proposed approach finds clones in three steps. First software modules are extracted. Then, the extracted modules are turned to time series. Finally, the time series are compared using the DTW algorithm to find clones. The results of the experiment conducted on a well-known Benchmark show that the approach can detect clones effectively in software systems."

CC manager has to manage the resources to provide services to the end-users of the healthcare sector. The SLAMMP framework discussed here shows how the resources are managed by using the concept of reinforcement learning (RL) and LSTM (long short-term memory) for monitoring and prediction of the cloud resources for healthcare organizations. The task(s) pattern and anti-pattern scenarios have been observed using HMM (hidden Markov model). These patterns will tune the SLA parameters (service level agreement) using blockchain-based smart contracts (SC). The result discussed here indicates that the variations in the cloud resource demand will be handled carefully using the SLAMMP framework.

The observer is then proposed including output correction terms and also spatial derivatives of the output of order depending on the number of distinct diffusivities. It ensures arbitrarily fast state estimation in the sup-norm. The result is illustrated with a simulated example of a Lotka-Volterra system."

Most patients will have these baseline symptoms, with periodic flare-ups known as exacerbations. This article focuses on pharmacological therapy in a stable COPD patient. Pharmacological treatment of a stable COPD patient focuses on minimizing symptoms, improving exercise tolerance, and preventing exacerbations.

One major challenge in residential DR is how to learn and handle unknown and uncertain customer behaviors. In this letter, we consider the residential DR problem where the load service entity (LSE) aims to select an optimal subset of customers to optimize some DR performance, such as maximizing the expected load reduction with a financial budget or minimizing the expected squared deviation from a target reduction level. To learn the uncertain customer behaviors influenced by various time-varying environmental factors, we formulate the residential DR as a contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, and develop an online learning and selection (OLS) algorithm based on Thompson sampling to solve it. This algorithm takes the contextual information into consideration and is applicable to complicated DR settings. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the learning effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

"WOS:000545569800002"	""	""	"We present a novel reformulation of nonsmooth differential equations with state jumps enabling their easier simulation and use in optimal control problems without the need for integer variables. The main idea is to introduce an auxiliary differential equation to mimic the state jump map. Thereby, a clock state is introduced which does not evolve during the runtime of the auxiliary system. The pieces of the trajectory that correspond to the parts when the clock state was evolving recover the solution of the original system with jumps. Our reformulation results in nonsmooth ordinary differential equations where the discontinuity is in the first time derivative of the trajectory, rather than in the trajectory itself. This class of systems is easier to handle both theoretically and numerically. The reformulation is suitable for partially elastic mechanical impact problems. We provide numerical examples demonstrating the ease of use of this reformulation in both simulation and optimal control. In the optimal control example, we solve a sequence of nonlinear programming problems (NLPs) in a homotopy penalization approach and recover a time-optimal trajectory with state jumps."

The collection of motor data was based on the qualitative test described by the authors Gallahue and Ozmun (2005). The evaluated movement is the kicking motor skill and its classification was made according to the motor stages (initial, elementary and mature). Data on motor experience were collected through a questionnaire about the participants' daily routine. Both instruments applied in this study were previously validated by the Delphy Method. The chi square test (association of variables p<.05) was used for the analysis of categories: motor experience, sex and motor stages. We found a significant difference between the sex and motor stage categories. The present study revealed a motor lag demonstrated by the low levels of movement proficiency. The data also pointed to a more effective male motor performance. Therefore, it is important to rethink how motor stimulation and orientation (directed or not) is developing between both sexes in spaces where they feel these experiences."

The maximum-likelihood estimate for the unknown parameters of the BETE was established and assessed by the simulation studies. The maximum likelihood estimation of the stress-strength parameter is discussed and its asymptotic distribution is obtained. The effectiveness and usefulness of the BETE are demonstrated by the use of three real data set, in which the BETE provide a better fit than some other existing distributions and demonstrated its capability in the stress-strength reliability analysis."

As well as using data for commercial ends, gambling operators in the UK market are obligated by law to utilise gamblers' data to protect problem gamblers. This paper argues that the use of data in this way can be interpreted as a form of social control when observed through a Foucauldian lens. Contrary to the dominant narrative of free and informed choice, gamblers' behaviour is arguably being governed both at an individual level through disciplinary mechanisms of surveillance and correction, and at the level of the population through governmentality techniques applied to the gambling environment. Through big data practices and industry discourse, these mechanisms of power are used to frame the choices of individuals and shape them into a productive population of `responsible gamblers'."

The cover of the solar still was made of transparent polythene film, while the frame was made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Mild steel cylindrical hollow pipes of 0.035 m diameter were used as fins in the solar still. The performance of this solar still (PSSCHF) was compared with the performance of a conventional solar still (PSS1) which was made of similar fabrication materials, but without using fins in its basin. Each solar still basin contained water with the depth of 1 cm that was collected from a pond located at the Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) campus. Both PSSCHF and PSS1 solar stills were exposed to similar climatic conditions within the same locality at USM during the experiments. The purpose of using the fins in the basin of PSSCHF was to absorb more heat from solar irradiance. The PSSCHF attained a maximum productivity of 4.49 l/m(2).d, whereas the PSS1 obtained a maximum water production of 3.97 l/m(2).d. The quality of fresh water produced from the solar stills met the World Health Organization potable water standards."

A data-driven set invariance verification approach relying on the observation of trajectories is proposed to determine almost-invariant sets, which are invariant almost everywhere except possibly in a small subset. With these observations, scenario optimization problems are formulated. We show that probabilistic invariance guarantees on the almost-invariant sets can be established. To get explicit expressions of such sets, a set identification procedure is designed by the use of a polynomial classifier. The practical performance of the proposed data-driven framework is illustrated by numerical examples."	"The work of Raphael M.

In addition, we introduce a model of risk to optimize the product of the likelihood and the future impact of an outbreak. We demonstrate with a simplified wildfire example that our method can provide more targeted resource allocation compared to previous approaches based on geometric programming."

Bone formation is a dynamic process influenced by various growth factors. Angiogenesis is a fundamental phase and essential in the early stages of bone regeneration. Because of insufficient vascularization within osteoconductive or osteoinductive bone scaffolds, VEGF can be loaded into the scaffolds structure to induce blood vessels throughout engineered tissue. For this propose, PLA-g-P(HEM-co-NIPAAM) copolymers with HEMA:NIPAAm ratio of 1:1 and 1:5 are synthesized, and their biocompatibility, swelling, and vascular endothelial growth factor release properties are investigated. The hydrogels were biocompatible, and the cell attachment and growth were increased facing these hydrogels. The swelling performance of the synthesized hydrogels is increased by increasing the PHEMA ratio in the copolymer, which leads to high loading capacity. Different specifications for percent released over different time periods were achieved for the as-synthesized hydrogel, which will play a powerful role in bone regeneration in the near future."

These problems are thoroughly studied for linear dynamics. However, in spite of a number of open research questions, methods for nonlinear network dynamics are less developed. As observed by various studies, the prevailing graph-based controllability approaches for selecting control nodes might result in significantly suboptimal control performance for nonlinear dynamics. We present a new, intuitive, and simple method for simultaneous control node selection and control sequence design for complex networks with nonlinear dynamics. The method is developed by incorporating the control node selection problem into an open-loop optimal control problem and by approximately solving the resulting mixed-integer optimization problem using a mesh adaptive direct search method. The developed framework is numerically robust and can deal with stiff networks and with control and actuator constraints. Good numerical performance of the method is demonstrated by testing it on prototypical Duffing oscillator and associative memory networks. The developed codes that can easily be adapted to models of other complex systems are available online."

To date, there exists no medication to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection and novel new therapeutics are still being explored to prevent or limit the damage to the lung. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is an effective bioactive lipid mediator and its related signaling pathways are vital for endothelial cell integrity.

Data were compared by a two-way ANOVA considering the factor playing position (defender, midfielder, and forward) throughout the season. Forwards carried out more actions on the offensive principle of space and width than defenders and midfielders throughout the season (p = .04). In addition, an improvement in tactical performance was verified (p = .001), as well as some variations regarding the incidence of offensive unity and defensive coverage actions throughout the season in all positions (p = .001)."

Modelling of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is included in the proposed POPF to represent the wind energy conversion system (WECS). To reduce DFIG imposed deviation of bus voltage ancillary reactive power support is considered. Moreover, three different optimization techniques, namely, MSA, biogeography-based optimization (BBO), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) are independently applied for the minimization of active power generation cost for wind-thermal coordination, considering different instances in case of IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus system. From the simulation results, it is confirmed and validated that the proposed MSA performs considerably better than BBO and PSO."

In this study, Candida glabrata, a common yeast found in fermented food, was evaluated in terms of its capability to produce ethanol using different types of carbohydrates, which included simple saccharides (glucose, maltose, sucrose), polysaccharides (starch and cellulose) and complex carbohydrates (total sago effluent, TSE). Our results indicated that C. glabrata was able to efficiently produce ethanol from glucose at 79.84% TEY (Theoretical Ethanol Yield). The ethanol production from sucrose was low, which was only 6.44% TEY, while no ethanol was produced from maltose. Meanwhile, for complex carbohydrate substrates such as starch and cellulose, ethanol was produced only when supplementary enzymes were introduced. Simultaneous Saccharification and Fermentation (SSF) of starch dosed with amylases resulted in an ethanol yield of 55.08% TEY, whilst SSF of cellulose dosed with cellulases yielded a TEY of 31.41%. When SSF was performed on TSE dosed with amylases and cellulases, the highest ethanol production was recorded within 24 h, with a yield of 23.36% TEY. Lactic acid and acetic acid were found to be at minimal levels throughout the fermentation period, indicating an efficient ethanol conversion. A notable increase in C. glabrata biomass was observed in cultures fed with glucose, starch (with supplementary amylases), and TSE (with supplementary amylases and cellulases). The current study indicates that C. glabrata can be used for bioethanol production from glucose, polysaccharides, and complex starchy lignocellulosic substrates such as TSE via SSF."

Recognizing that a suitable directional sampling feature could potentially enhance the performance of the GSE algorithm further, this letter proposes two sampling schemes - basic and augmented directional sampling - and presents GSE-D and GSE-AD algorithms, respectively, as expansion over the GSE. These algorithms, by default, enjoy the advantages of the GSE. Both the directional sampling schemes enable drawing random sample points with more preference towards the direction of the Goal leading to lower cost of computed shortest path on an average. While the basic directional sampling strategy faces a drawback in computational time when obstacle density in the direction towards the Goal is high, the augmented directional sampling scheme is free of this limitation. Probabilistic analysis and extensive numerical simulation studies show the effectiveness of the GSE-D and GSE-AD in performance in terms of computational time efficiency and shortest path cost when compared with the GSE, other seminal and existing directional algorithms."

UV-Visible absorption and normalized fluorescence spectra were applied to analyze the optical properties of GQDs at different pH. DLS and AFM had been performed to study the mean particle size and the morphology of the GQDs. Further, the photocatalytic behavior of the synthesized GQDs obtained at pH 10 was used in the degradation of dyes viz. Methylene Blue and Methyl Orange under visible-light irradiation. The influence of certain parameters such as pH of the GQD, contact time, a dosage of GQDs, and the kinetic model was demonstrated.

These fibers find applications in tunnel linings, hydraulic structures, bridge decks, pavements and slope stabilization. The fiber length has positive influence on compressive strength (increased by more than 10%), flexural strength (increased by more than 50%) and split-tensile strength(increased by more than 30%) while slump and flow (increased by more than 80%) were reduced but can be avoided through careful mixing, reduction of coarse aggregates and utilization of short fibers. Utilization of WTSF contributes to the sustainability of the construction industry. This paper focuses on reviewing the contemporary management of waste tires, fresh and hardened properties of steel fibers extracted from the waste tires, usage of the steel fibers and the durability of concrete containing these fibers."

We find that defects in the lattice play a major role in determining the relaxation dynamics by trapping the photoexcited carriers and acting as non-radiative recombination centers that emit phonons. In the high carrier density regime explored in our experiments, we observe substantial changes in the transient absorbance signal at unexpectedly long-time delays which we attribute to phonon-induced band gap modification. Our probe frequency dependent measurements and modeling indicate a renormalization of the bandgap by up to 23 meV. These results highlight the importance of defects and phonons for optical applications of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides."

The algorithm is modeled as a switched linear system whose convergence properties are carefully studied considering the agents' piece-wise access to the reference signals. We also study the discrete-time implementation of this algorithm. Next, we show how a containment control problem in which a group of followers should track the convex hull of a set of observed leaders, can be cast as an active average consensus problem, and solved efficiently by our proposed dynamic active average consensus algorithm.

However, some structural problems have limited its application in more fragile groups. Objective: Analyze the safety, usability and experiences of IVR in older people. Method: 4 males (2 parkinsonian and 2 healthy, 57-78 years) participated in the study. They conducted an RVI session (10-15 minutes) with a Head-Mounted Display (HTC Vive Pro) device. The safety of immersive experience (SSQ), system usability (SUS), and impressions after experience (GEQ and an ad hoc satisfaction questionnaire to identify strengths and weaknesses of the tool) were evaluated. Results: Everyone completed the session successfully, without adverse effects. The usability of the system was good, even overcoming obstacles such as the presence of vision corrective glasses and hearing aids. Opinions after the session pointed out the positive experience and all participants showed their willingness to repeat it, describing it as entertaining, fun, and useful.

This approach is based on the use of symbolic models describing the dynamical system behavior with a finite description of the transition relation between its states. In the literature, many results using this approach assume the availability of full and exact information about the system states to compute the control actions. In this letter, we consider a more realistic scenario where only partial information about the plant states is available. This letter proposes an abstraction that makes it possible to synthesize output-feedback controllers. The presence of disturbances and output noise is also considered.

The review of extant literature suggests that the regulators are playing an important role in regulating the market to prevent market manipulation and market misconduct. The review also suggests that emerging economies are facing the issue of low institutional quality, absence of law enforcement agencies in the enforcement process, and definitional vagueness in relation to market manipulation. However, the findings suggest that enforcement mechanisms against market manipulation may discourage market abuses in both emerging and developed markets. The findings of this research offer some challenges and future directions in case of future market manipulation that potentially affect the market integrity of the firms.

This compound was characterized by FT-IR, H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR techniques. Then, the evaluation of corrosion inhibition and adsorption behavior of MD onto carbon steel was carried out in M-1 HCl using the weight loss analysis and electrochemical methods such as potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The inhibition efficiency was increased by the increase of both the dose of MD (0.72 to 5.65 mM) and the temperature of the medium (298 to 323 K). The thermodynamic kinetic parameters showed that the adsorption of MD on the carbon steel surface follows the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Furthermore, PDP measurements exhibited that the studied MD inhibitor performs as a mixed-type inhibitor. Finally, the density functional theory, molecular electrostatic potential and Monte Carlo studies were performed to gain an insight about adsorption mechanism, indicating that the MD inhibitor can effectively limit corrosion onto the carbon steel surface. Based on the results, we have concluded that the synthesized MD can be used as an efficient inhibitor to stop carbon steel surface corrosion."

Simply put, proofs can be direct or indirect- the latter using the Law of the Excluded Middle from logic as well as the axiom of Choice, to prove existence of mathematical objects. However, the thinking skills involved in writing indirect proofs are prone to errors, especially from novice proof writers such as prospective teachers. Creativity in mathematics entails the use of both direct and indirect approaches to determine the validity of a statement.

The swarm intelligence methodologies use artificial intelligence to solve computationally challenging problems like load balancing, scheduling, and resource allocation at finite time intervals. In literature, sufficient works are being carried out to address load balancing problem in the cloud using traditional swarm intelligence techniques like ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, cuckoo search, bat optimization, and so on. But the traditional swarm intelligence techniques have issues with respect to convergence rate, arriving at the global optimum solution, complexity in implementation and scalability, which limits the applicability of such techniques in cloud domain. In this paper, we look into performance modeling aspects of some of the recent competitive swarm artificial intelligence based techniques like the whale, spider, dragonfly, and raven which are used for load balancing in the cloud. The results and analysis are presented over performance metrics such as total execution time, response time, resource utilization rate, and throughput achieved, and it is found that the performance of the raven roosting algorithm is high compared to other techniques."

The lifespan effects of leaf varieties of P. esculentus fractions (vat-bebot, MV1) and 2 (vat-riyon, MV2) and their ameliorative effects on VCM-induced oxidative stress were evaluated in D. melanogaster. Flies were treated with vehicle (ethanol), Gallic Acid (0.1 mM), MV1 (100 mg/10 diet), MV2 (200 mg/10 diet), VCM (100 mu M), (VCM+Gallic Acid), (VCM+MV1) and (VCM+MV2) in the diets for 5 days. The results indicated that MV1 and MV2 reduced the lifespan of flies without affecting the survival of flies after 7 days of treatment. P. esculentus restored VCM-induced depletion of total thiol and inhibition of glutathione S-transferase, acetylcholinesterase, and catalase activities (p < 0.05).

"WOS:000549258800006"	""	""	"We propose an automatic and formally sound method for synthesising Lyapunov functions for the asymptotic stability of autonomous non-linear systems. Traditional methods are either analytical and require manual effort or are numerical but lack of formal soundness. Symbolic computational methods for Lyapunov functions, which are in between, give formal guarantees but are typically semi-automatic because they rely on the user to provide appropriate function templates. We propose a method that finds Lyapunov functions fully automatically-using machine learning-while also providing formal guarantees-using satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). We employ a counterexample-guided approach where a numerical learner and a symbolic verifier interact to construct provably correct Lyapunov neural networks (LNNs). The learner trains a neural network that satisfies the Lyapunov criteria for asymptotic stability over a samples set; the verifier proves via SMT solving that the criteria are satisfied over the whole domain or augments the samples set with counterexamples. Our method supports neural networks with polynomial activation functions and multiple depth and width, which display wide learning capabilities. We demonstrate our method over several non-trivial benchmarks and compare it favourably against a numerical optimisation-based approach, a symbolic template-based approach, and a cognate LNN-based approach. Our method synthesises Lyapunov functions faster and over wider spatial domains than the alternatives, yet providing stronger or equal guarantees."

The major objective of the load forecasting is to trim down the error between actual load and forecasted load. Due to the nonlinear nature of load forecasting and its dependency on multiple variables, the traditional forecasting methods are normally outperformed by artificial intelligence techniques. In this research paper, a robust short term load forecasting technique for one to seven days ahead is introduced based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and Levenberg Marquardt (LM) neural network forecast model, where the PSO and LM algorithm are used for the training process of neural network. The proposed methods are tested to predict the load of the New England Power Pool region's grid and compared with the existing techniques using mean absolute percentage errors to analyze the performance of the proposed methods.

Using the input to the system as the bifurcation parameter, we characterize the location of the admissible equilibria, show that bifurcations can arise only when equilibria lie on the boundary of well-defined regions of the state space, and prove that (codimension-one) bifurcations can only be of three different types: persistent, non-smooth fold, and Hopf. We show how these bifurcations change the qualitative properties of the system trajectories, and how these behaviors resemble prototypical patterns of EEG activity observed before, during, and after seizure events in the human brain. Our findings suggest that low-dimensional linear threshold models can effectively be used to model, analyze, predict, and ultimately regulate the interactions of neuronal populations in the human brain."

As an inspiration for the addressed class of models, we turn to mechanical systems driven by time-dependent holonomic (shock impacts, control vibrations) and/or nonholonomic (impactive blocking/releasing system's degrees of freedom) constraints. For our problems, we adapt an approach based on singular space-time transformation. This approach involves approximation of discontinuous solutions of the impulsive complementarity system by ordinary, physically meaningful control processes.

The properties of prepared rice husk-chitosan (Chi-RH) ere characterized using SEM, FTIR, and XRD analysis. The main parameters that influence cadmium sorption on the Chi-RH biocomposites were evaluated at different stirring and contact time, adsorbent dosage, and pH values. The results indicated that the best stirring time and contact time was 360 mins and 60 mins. respectively. The optimum adsorbent dosage was 1.0 g/L, with the highest percentage removal of 99%, and the optimum pH was 9. This study concluded that the Chi-RH biocomposites have the high ability as a green adsorbent for cadmium removal in aqueous solution and simultaneously reducing the environmental impact.

Antibiotic-resistant is considered as a major problem in Salmonella enterica Serovar. This study introduces a new simple and sensitive aptasensor based on chitosan (Chi)-electrospun carbon nanofibers (CNF) /gold nanoparticles (GNPs) decorated pencil graphite electrode (GE) as a novel platform for electrochemical detection of Salmonella enterica Serovar. A Salmonella-specific recognition aptamer ssDNA sequence was used in the development of this voltammetric biosensor. Electrochemical behaviors of electrodes; unmodified GE, CNF-Chi/GE, GNPs/CNF-Chi/GE, GNPs/CNF-Chi/GEs linked with the aptamer were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). After the optimization of experimental conditions (e.g., CNF concentration, pH, and incubation time), electrochemical detection of Salmonella was performed via differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in methylene blue solution. The designed aptasensor exhibited a linear range of 10 to 10(5) (CFU/mL) with the limit of detection (LOD) 1.223 (Cfu/mL) for Salmonella. This aptasensor displayed excellent selectivity and remarkable sensitivity in terms of the detection of Salmonella enterica even in the real samples as compared to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The constructed aptasensor is a highly sensitive sensor for the detection of Salmonella enterica and also can be tailored for various other targets."

PTES, (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane, was used as a covalent cross-linker for tight-binding of the GO layers. By the combination of GO sorption capacity and APTES cross-linking ability, the developed solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibers exhibited a very good chemical/mechanical stability and high extraction efficiency. The developed fibers were used for headspace sampling of nicotine from the hair of smokers, without any sample preparation step. The determination of the analyte was done using GC-FID technique. Despite the thin thickness of GO multilayer, it was very robust and durable and its performance was better than traditional GO coatings and polyacrylate commercial fibers. The most important experimental variables were studied. Under the optimal conditions, the limit of detection and relative standard deviation (RSD%, n = 3) was 0.02 mu g g(-1), 5.6-8.9%, respectively.

Yet, smart contracts as recognisable or valid legal instruments within the boundaries of contract or property law remain uncertain and contentious. Contrary to perceptions of contractual streamlining and efficiency, understanding the uncertainty smart contracts produce lies in the technology's failure to meet many of the fundamental principles of contract law and theory concerning, for example, breach of promise and remedy for breach. Smart contracts appear to reduce contracting to a form and standard well below that developed by contract law and theory over many centuries in both civil and common law jurisdictions. Including elements of the law of restitution, this article's remedial analysis will examine smart contracts considering 'traditional' contract law to understand and, where possible, test the legal legitimacy of this post-human technology, and explore the potential of smart contracts to supplement or, in time, supersede traditional contract law."

An existing filtering algorithm can achieve only low-pass filter characteristics, which limits its range of applications. To address this limitation, we extend the aforementioned filtering algorithm using an additional design parameter. We then present a characterization of all the realizable filter characteristics as a necessary and sufficient condition for achieving distributed spatial filtering. As a result, it is shown that the extended algorithm increases the range of the realizable filter characteristics. The proposed method is verified not only by simulation but also by denoising experiments for a real sensor network. The results show that the proposed method effectively reduces spatial noise and achieves higher performance than an average consensus algorithm and an average filter."

As these models are employed in learning-based control, the quality of the data plays a crucial role for the performance of the resulting control law. Nevertheless, there hardly exist measures for assessing training data sets, and the impact of the spatial distribution of the data on the closed-loop system properties is largely unknown. This letter derives - based on Gaussian process models - an analytical relationship between the density of the training data and the control performance. We formulate a quality measure for the data set, which we refer to as rho-gap, and derive the ultimate bound for the tracking error under consideration of the model uncertainty. We show how the rho-gap can be applied to a feedback linearizing control law and provide numerical illustrations for our approach."

The importance of the topic has forced the author not only to review the ideas of academics, but also to provide a foundation of recognition for cybercrime. The results show that jurists believe that acts of depravity should be prosecuted through punishment; and in some cases they have condemned it as mofsed-e-filarz, which is punishable by death. Likewise, the points of view of jurists have been investigated; research has been based on research. Through the investigations carried out, it is made clear that certain crimes that have been used by social networks to decrease chastity in society include the disclosure of adultery, pimping, pornography, etc., which have been referred to by legislators and saints imams and the Prophet.. In the first step, these crimes are not only against the offender, but also target and weaken the foundations of the most important units of any society, which are families."

However, these properties of concrete significantly changed if subjected to higher temperature. Thus, this paper presents the effect of partial replacement of cement to CWP with different weight percent (0%, 20%, 40% and 60%) on the workability, dry density and compressive strength of the concrete. In addition, the influence of elevated temperature (200-800 degrees C) at 2 h was also carried to investigate the effect on residual compressive strength of the concrete. Furthermore, ANOVA analysis was used for the prediction and optimization of the influenced variables on the compressive strength (response) of the concrete mixes. The results showed that the CWP and temperature significantly influenced the workability, dry density and compressive strength of the concrete mixes. And increasing the percentages of CWP leads to a reduction in the workability, dry density and compressive strength of the concrete mixes. The highest values of workability, dry density and compressive strength were obtained as 240 mm and 220 mm, 2200 kg/m3 and 2215 kg/m3 and 30 MPa and 33 MPa for A-20 and B-20 mixes, respectively, whereas increasing the temperature caused to decrease the compressive strength of the concrete, and in this context, the maximum residual compressive strength was observed as 32 MPa and 36 MPa for A-20 and B-20, respectively, at 200 degrees C. Furthermore, CW-A and temperature significantly impact the compressive strength of the concrete, whereas CW-B not. For the optimization, 22% of CW-A, 31.5% of CW-B and 122 degrees C provide the optimum compressive strength of the concrete. These results give a good indication that CWP could be used in the production of eco-friendly concrete with improved mechanical properties."
