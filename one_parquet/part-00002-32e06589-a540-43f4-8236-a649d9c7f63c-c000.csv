The investigative dynamics started from a diagnostic phase where a psychopedagogical analysis of the intellectual potentialities and limitations was carried out, used as a reference to develop a psychopedagogical strategy that would allow the development of professional skills, the proposal was built inductively through workshops with the participation of teaches involved; Actions were define for curricular adaptations and levels of aid adjusted to the student's needs. Three cuts were applied in the evaluation of the variable under study, placing each one at the end of the ordinary academic periods (PAO), each period with 16 weeks. The results of the three moments were contrasted using the Friedman non-parametric test, it is found that between the first and second PAO there arc no significant differences, however, between the first and third PAO the significance of the changes showed that p = .001, as it is less than the preset value (p <.05), it is accepted (Hi) and the feasibility of the intervention in practice is demonstrated. The actions derived from the Strategy generated professional competencies that will allow the student to perform as an assisted Monitor, but not as a Superior Technologist, a decision recommended by the faculty for professional practice, considering that Sports Training constitutes a highly complex pedagogical process"	""	"35"	"Inst Tecnol Super Libertad, Quito, Ecuador, Univ Metropolitana Ecuador, Guayaquil, Ecuador, Univ Cent Ecuador, Quito, Ecuador, Univ Estatal Guayaquil, Guayaquil, Ecuador"	"Univ Metropolitana Ecuador, Guayaquil, Ecuador"	""	"2021"	"2021"	""	"39"	""	""	""	""	"576"	"584"	"9"	"MURCIA"	"C CABO VIDIO 27, SAN JAVIER, MURCIA, 30730, SPAIN"	"FEDERACION ESPANOLA ASOC DOCENTES EDUCACION FISICA-FEADEF"	"INCLUSION"	""	""	""	""	"Article"	"1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6"	"1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6"	"Ale de la Rosa, Yaxel 1| Esteces Fajardo, Isabel 6| Guillen Pereira, Lisbet 2| Gutierrez Cruz, Manuel 5| Herrera Camacho, Angelica Paola 3| Rodriguez Torres, Angel Freddy 4"	"Ale de la Rosa, Yaxel 1| Esteces Fajardo, Isabel 6| Guillen Pereira, Lisbet 2| Gutierrez Cruz, Manuel 5| Herrera Camacho, Angelica Paola 3| Rodriguez Torres, Angel Freddy 4"	"1| 3| 4| 5| 6| guillenp7212@gmail.com 2"	"Development of professional competencies in people with disabilities for the practice of Sports Training: a view from the Andres case"	"RETOS-NUEVAS TENDENCIAS EN EDUCACION FISICA DEPORTE Y RECREACION"	"RETOS-NUEV TEND EDUC"	"Retos"	"1579-1726"	""	"1988-2041"	""	""	""	""

The tripod turnstile machine also helps in stopping the crime and restricting the entry of unauthorized person on the premises. In this paper, the aim is to analyze the reliability measures of the two tripod turnstile machines which work in a parallel configuration. In the case of non-functionality of the machine, unauthorized persons may enter into the premises. Due to security and safety reason, organizations install these machines. Hence these machines must be highly reliable in the operation to avoid any unwanted event. In this paper, for the considered system, the transition state diagram has been drawn with the help of the Markov model. The ChapmanKolmogorov differential equations are developed from the transition state diagram and solved using Laplace transformation. The failure and repair rates are assumed to be constant and follow negative exponential distribution. The system upstate and downstate probabilities are determined. The explicit expression of the system Availability, Reliability and MTTF are also obtained. The sensitivity analysis is also performed to determine which machine affects the system reliability the most."	"The authors are highly thankful to HONESTY AUTOMATION PVT.

Considerable work has been done in the area of sensor node placement to ensure adequate coverage of the area of interest. However, in many applications it may not be possible to accurately place individual sensor nodes. In such cases, imprecise placement can result in regions, referred to as coverage holes, that are not monitored by any sensor node. The use of mobile nodes that can 'visit' such uncovered regions after deployment has been proposed in the literature as an effective way to maintain adequate coverage. In this paper, the authors propose a novel integer linear programming (ILP) formulation that determines the paths the mobile node(s) should take to realize the specified level of coverage in the shortest time. The authors also present a heuristic algorithm that can be used for larger networks."	"The work of A.

Neurotransmitters may act as 'matchmaker' between gut microbiota imbalance and mental disorders. Most of the relevant research effort goes into the relationship between gut microbiota and neurotransmitters and the other between neurotransmitters and mental disorders, while few studies collect and analyze the dispersed research results in systematic ways. We therefore gather the dispersed results that in the existing studies into a structured knowledge base for identifying and predicting the potential relationships between gut microbiota and mental disorders. In this study, we propose to construct a gut microbiota knowledge graph for mental disorder, which named as MiKG4MD. It is extendable by linking to future ontologies by just adding new relationships between existing information and new entities. This extendibility is emphasized for the integration with existing popular ontologies/terminologies, e.g. UMLS, MeSH, and KEGG. We demonstrate the performance of MiKG4MD with three SPARQL query test cases. Results show that the MiKG4MD knowledge graph is an effective method to predict the relationships between gut microbiota and mental disorders."

Specifically, 38 indoor courts from pavilions were analyzed (19 from the province of Caceres and 19 from the province of Badajoz), filling out 1673 items with the accessibility questionnaire proposed by the Spanish Sports Council and the Biomechanical Institute of Valencia (CSD/IBV, 2009). The results showed that the average percentage of accessibility was 50.6%. The zones with the highest accessibility score were the rooms and offices (72%), and elevators (88%). On the contrary, the areas with the lowest accessibility rate were the reception (13%), and the dining hall/restaurant/bar (33%). These results revealed that physical accessibility is not complete, and therefore, the participation of groups of persons with reduced mobility in sport programmes offered by the local governments could decrease due to the existence of different accessibility barriers. It is recommended to improve the physical accessibility in sports facilities since it would increase the participation of people with reduced mobility in sports activities, and therefore, their integration and normalization in the daily activities of society."

The main challenge of data anonymization is to find a balance between data utility and the amount of disclosure risk. One of the most known frameworks of data anonymization is k-anonymity, this method assumes that a dataset is anonymous if and only if for each element of the dataset, there exist at least k - 1 elements identical to it. In this paper, we propose two techniques to achieve k-anonymity through microaggregation: k-CMVM and Constrained-CMVM. Both, use topological collaborative clustering to obtain k-anonymous data. The first one determines the k levels automatically and the second defines it by exploration. We also improved the results of these two approaches by using pLVQ2 as a weighted vector quantization method. The four methods proposed were proven to be efficient using two data utility measures, the separability utility and the structural utility. The experimental results have shown a very promising performance."

By using this class of networks to approximate the MPC-related cost function subject to the given system dynamics and input constraint, we avoid two of the main bottlenecks of classical MPC: the availability of an accurate model for the system being controlled, and the computational cost of solving the MPC-induced optimization problem. The former is tackled by exploiting the universal approximation capabilities of this class of networks. The latter is alleviated by making use of the difference-of-convex-functions structure of these networks. Furthermore, we show that the system driven by the MPC-neural structure is practically stable."

Feature selection is a crucial step in Text classification. It is a vital preprocessing technique for powerful data analysis, where only a subset from the original data features is chosen by removing noisy, irrelevant, or redundant features. In this paper, a feature selection method utilizing the combination of chi-square and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is proposed. Chi-square, a filter method that is computationally fast, simple and has the ability to deal with a large dimensional feature, is used as the first level of the feature selection process. After that, the wrapper method, Artificial Bee Colony algorithm, is used as the second level where Naive Base is used as a fitness function. The results showed that a reduced number of features outperformed classification accuracy to that using the original features set. Furthermore, the proposed method had a better performance compared with the chi-square method and the ABC algorithm as a feature selection method."

The formation of nanoparticles was established by spectrophotometer (UV-vis) at a wavelength of 425 nm while it was kept for one month at room temperature for stability checking. Dynamic Light Scattering analysis revealed the formation of stable Cr2O3 NPs measuring 85-90 nm in diameter. Furthermore, Cr2O3 NPs and Cannabis sativa leaves extract were checked for anti-cancer activity in HepG(2) cell lines. The recorded percent cell viability of HepG(2) was 64.10 at a minimum concentration (0.01 ppm), whereas at a maximum concentration (10 ppm) it was reduced to 47.25 % after 12 hrs. Further, at 24 hrs, it was reduced up to 21 % and 34.45 % at a minimum and maximum concentrations, respectively. Hence, green synthesized Cr2O3 NPs possessed promising anti-cancer activity. Loss in weight method is used to evaluate the corrosion inhibition activity on mild steel in 0.5 M HCl, HNO3, and NH3 solutions. The value of IE also increases with increasing the concentration of Cr2O3 NPs. It is clear that in basic (NH3) medium, Cr2O3 NPs show the highest inhibition performance of about 89%, and in an acidic medium, it was80%at 1.0 g/l concentration. The concentration of Cr2O3 NPs increases with a decrease in the rate of corrosion, which confirmed an increase in the efficiency of inhibition."

The extracurricular activities are in clear growth since the parents consider that they are a fundamental element in the fonnation of their sons and daughters, for that reason they suppose a great number of urban displacements and in this way they become a possibility to foment the active displacement. In this sense it is necessary before intervening to analyze the habits of displacement, to be able to design appropriate interventions in the future. There are no validated instruments and therefore, in the present investigation a questionnaire that serves as a tool for future research is validated. Methodology: The sample consisted of 125 students from the 5th and 6h degree of Primal) , Education (67 boys and 58 girls), as an instrument for data collection, an adaptation of the PACO questionnaire was used for extracurricular activities. Results: the majority of the trips to extracurricular activities/lessons in the study were by car (60.3% to the exiracunicular activities and 59.5% to return home). The results showed moderate reliability in tenors of travel mode (K = .62, in the outbound and K =.50, in the return) and in terms of the time it takes to arrive (k = 0.59) and acceptable level in the distance to extracurricular students (K = .34). Discussion: The level of reliability of the proposed questionnaire is moderate and therefore, it might be used as a measuring instrument of the different types of commuting, adult accompaniment and number of weekly trips. Low values of reliability have been found in the questions about distance to the extracurricular activities school and in the time it takes to arrive. It is necessary to design new tools to measure these variables."

The model takes into account wear of the contact surface of the body caused by the friction. Existence and uniqueness results are proved by using arguments of elliptic variational inequalities. This makes the problem evolutionary and leads to a new and nonstandard mathematical model which couples a time-dependent variational inequality with an integral equation. Frictional contact between a deformable body and a foundation is a phenomenon that occurs in various forms in different physical settings. In any particular case, different factors can influence the behavior of the body. Such factors include, for example, constitutive law of the body, friction law that describes the contact with the foundation, the influence of the temperature or piezoelectricity effects. This is why different models have been developed in the field of contact mechanics. We provide the unique weak solvability of the model by using a fixed point argument.

Similarly, the current situation has exerted tremendous pressure on supply-chains from those found in the medical area to personal and household items since over- demand has put on testing the current logistic infrastructures. This pair of elements and primarily the vertiginous increase in the number of incidents by COVID-19 worldwide have risen the need to use active technologies to tackle the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, Blockchain, 5G, among others. For instance, in combination with Robotics and its interaction with humans, Machine Learning has gained space to manage the virus's propagation in hospitals, airports, transport systems, recreational areas, restaurants, and conglomerates in general. In particular, against mobility regulation and limited interaction among people, autonomous robotic vehicles' potential is crucial in reducing human contact and the possible disruptive transmission of the virus. Beyond the continuous advance of autonomous navigation and its impact on propagating the pandemic, this work focuses its discussion on the main uses and applications of cutting-edge industrial technologies against the contingency. Part of this work also involves unconventional applications of unmanned land vehicles at the service of current requirements and how Artificial Intelligence, in conjunction with mobile Robotics, becomes enabling technologies in various sectors of the economy.

The fault isolation approach is based on a closed-loop concept, where the feedback controller is an integrated part of the set-up. The YJBK-parameterization (after Youla, Jabr, Bongiorno, and Kucera) for controllers is introduced. This allows the feedback controller to be modified by changing the YJBK matrix transfer function without changing the nominal feedback controller. Modification of the feedback controller via the YJBK transfer matrix causes the output residual response to be changed in the case of parametric faults and unchanged in the fault-free case. This facilitates fault detection. In the isolation case, the controller is modified in a way such that the residual response from the closed-loop system is independent of the modification for one specific parametric fault and else it depends on the parametric faults. This allows for any specific fault and eventually for all faults to be isolated."

In this letter, we propose a sample-efficient multi-robot learning method based on guided policy search to learn decentralized swarm control policies. The proposed method uses distributed trajectory optimization to provide guiding trajectory samples for policy training. In turn, the learned policy is exploited to update the trajectory optimization results so that the guiding trajectories are reproducible by the current policy. A learning algorithm is designed to alternate between distributed trajectory optimization and policy optimization, which eventually converges to a solution with good long-term performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a multi-robot rendezvous problem. The simulation results in a robot simulator show that our method efficiently learn decentralized control policy with substantially less training samples."

In contrast to the existing work, we use gradient tracking to improve certain aspects of the resulting algorithm. In particular, we propose the S-ADDOPT algorithm that assumes a stochastic first-order oracle at each node and show that for a constant step-size alpha, each node converges linearly inside an error ball around the optimal solution, the size of which is controlled by alpha. For decaying step-sizes O(1/k), we show that S-ADDOPT reaches the exact solution sublinearly at O(1/k) and its convergence is asymptotically network-independent. Thus the asymptotic behavior of S-ADDOPT is comparable to the centralized stochastic gradient descent. Numerical experiments over both strongly convex and non-convex problems illustrate the convergence behavior and the performance comparison of the proposed algorithm."

Other than mathematics, Omar Khayyam also made considerable contributions to other fields, such as astronomy, philosophy, and poetry (Struik, 1958). He is probably most famous for his poem titled Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, which was translated by Edward Fitzgerald (Struik, 1958). Although famous for his poetry, he was professionally inclined to astronomy and mathematics. In mathematics, he is well-known for being the first individual to find positive root solutions to multiple cubic equations, and he is also known for furthering understanding of the parallel axiom (Eves, 1958, p. 285; Struik, 1958).

In particular, we address the problem of estimating the aggregate marginals of a Markov chain from noisy aggregate observations in an incremental (online) fashion. We propose a sliding window Sinkhorn belief propagation (SW-SBP) algorithm that utilizes a sliding window filter of the most recent noisy aggregate observations along with encoded information from discarded observations. Our algorithm is built upon the recently proposed multi-marginal optimal transport based SBP algorithm that leverages standard belief propagation and Sinkhorn algorithm to solve inference problems from aggregate data.

The study was conducted in a 20 km-section covering from San Miguel de Santo Domingo to San Antonio de Belk, which is fed by the Tibas River as the main tributary and some discharges of wastewater resulting from various productive activities. The study used a quantitative approach and a MOHID Land model, as well as experimental and historical data of the variables needed for modeling. The model implemented is a numerical program that simulates the dynamics between water-soil and solute transport processes. For purposes of this study, two quality indicators, dissolved oxygen and biochemical oxygen demand, was the concentration modeled. The results obtained in the modeling presented a good adjustment in contrast to the data used for model validation; the error percentages obtained are rated as very good, good, and satisfactory, which can generally be described as an applicable model. Despite this, a more robust calibration needs to be developed along with a sensitivity analysis. There should be a greater dissemination of the use of this tool for the integrated management of water resources in the country.Th is study serves as a basis for the future modeling of other physicochemical parameters of water bodies, as well as its application in other similar rivers."

For this purpose leaching of the metals from the spent catalyst sample was conducted using both adapted and unadapted bacteria cultures. The evaluation was done on the basis of the variation of different leaching parameters such as pH. temperature, particle size, pulp density, and initial Fe(II) concentration. The adaptation technique as found to be fruitful as the leaching equilibrium reduced from 240 to 40hr. Further, the leaching rate of Ni and V was improved by 10%(w/w) due to bacterial adaptation. The leaching rate of Mo as lover due to combining the action of different factors like the presence of impervious elemental sulfur refractor nature and low solubility. The lower leaching rate of Al observed due to the refractoriness of the alumina matrix present in the spent catalyst sample. The pseudo rate order with respect to all leaching parameters was determined and found to be significant for the adaptation process. (C) 2020 by the authors.

Therefore, it is sought to identify which FIHE can be considered efficient given the contribution of public expenditure applied in them, as well as to determine the factors that affect this efficiency. Methodology: The empirical strategy adopted for this purpose consists of two stages. Firstly, the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model was used to obtain the efficiency scores of the FIHE, making it possible to rank them in order to identify the most technically efficient units. Then, with the aforementioned scores, tobit regression models were estimated to find the main factors that affect the efficiency of the universities. Findings: The results of the DEA approach indicated that in order to increase the rationality of the resources in Brazilian higher education (at the federal level) it would be necessary, considering the current level of attendance and the General Index of Courses (GIC), a cost reduction of about 25%, a decrease in the number of teachers around 22%, and in particular a reduction in the number of administrative staff by approximately 43%. Regarding the results of the regression analysis, these indicated that the FIHE's efficiency can be influenced by both the characteristics of the students and the region, as well as by management factors. The research points out how a managerial improvement could be achieved by increasing the student-teacher ratio and decreasing the staff-teacher ratio. Contributions: The contribution of the research is in the sense of supporting a better allocation of educational resources, also helping to formulate more effective public policies."

We considered two different levels in membrane cholesterol content. Because there is no evidence supporting the capacity of BACE1 and BACE2 to exist as a dimer, single and double (BACE1/BACE1, BACE2/BACE2, BACE1/BACE2) systems, either in parallel or antiparallet orientation, were prepared for each run. Analysis of tridimensional structure of BACE1 and BACE2, after 10ns of MD simulation, revealed a correlation between higher cholesterol levels and both peptide refolding and changes in the secondary structure of both transmembrane domains in single and double systems. Interestingly, our results also indicate a potential interaction in the double system BACE2/BACE2, particularly when the domains had an antiparallel orientation."

Generally, the literature has focused on the factors affecting direct investments towards developing and underdeveloped countries. The primary purpose of this study is to identify the factors affecting FDI inflow to Afghanistan. Different from previous studies, this study examined the effects of the following factors; globalization indices, gross domestic product, export volume, import volume, and exchange rate (USD/AFN) of Afghani. The factors were determined based on a review of the literature. Regarding the interaction across variables, three different regression models were tested to examine the effects of those factors on FDI inflows to Afghanistan. Ordinary Least Squares estimation was employed. According to the results of the integrated model (the model that covers all exploratory variables), globalization has a statistically significant positive effect on FDI, whereas the gross domestic product (GDP) has a statistically significant negative effect on FDI. When we test the effect of GDP and exchange rate (EXC) jointly on FDI, we find the statistically significant positive effect of those variables on FDI. The results of this study recommend the economy politicians in Afghanistan implement exchange rate policies that promote the FDI and to increase the inflowing of FDI into the country."

In most cases, the true interest rate applied to a credit is much higher than its nominal interest rate. Usually, this is due to the existence of some additional fees to be paid by the card holder, and to the process of splitting the periods of interest. However, the contracted annual interest rate of revolving cards is very high which, together with their peculiar amortization system, gives rise to an excessive amount of interests. The objective of this paper is to describe and analyze, from a legal and financial point of view, the main characteristics of the credit repayment in revolving cards.

To calculate this, the energy distribution of particles is characterized by either the source spectrum or fluence spectrum. Also, the average can be frequency- or dose-weighted. This makes four methods of calculating the average LET, each producing a different number. The purpose of this note is to describe which of these four methods is best suited for radiobiological modelling. We focused on data for photons (x-rays and gamma radiation) because in this case differences in the four averaging methods are most pronounced. However, our conclusions are equally applicable to photons and hadrons. We based our arguments on recently emerged Monte Carlo data that fully account for transport of electrons down to very low energies comparable to the ionization potential of water. We concluded that the frequency average LET calculated using the fluence spectrum has better predictive power than does that calculated using any of the other three options.

It is interesting to show that the irregular output feedback control with the standard average LQ cost is unsolvable even if the state feedback LQ control is solvable, which is completely different from the classical regular output feedback LQ control. In order to guarantee the solvability of the irregular output feedback control, the LQ cost is modified at the terminal time with the expectation of terminal state in this letter. In the framework of the modified cost function, it is shown that the separation principle holds and the explicitly optimal controller is given in the feedback form of the Kalman filtering. In particular, the feedback gain is calculated by two Riccati equations, independently of the Kalman filtering. The key technique is the analytical solution of the forward and backward differential equations (FBDEs).

The method combines ideas from tube-based and scenario-based MPC strategies in order to approximate the expected cost and to guarantee robust state and input constraint satisfaction. In particular, we design a feedback policy that is a function of the disturbance mode and allows the controller to take less conservative actions.

"WOS:000552266300007"	""	""	"With the increasing sophistication of attacks on cyber-physical systems, deception has emerged as an effective tool to improve system security and safety by obfuscating the attacker's perception. In this letter, we present a solution to the deceptive game in which a control agent is to satisfy a Boolean objective specified by a co-safe temporal logic formula in the presence of an adversary. The agent intentionally introduces asymmetric information to create payoff misperception, which manifests as the misperception of the labeling function in the game model. Thus, the adversary is unable to accurately determine which logical formula is satisfied by a given outcome of the game. We introduce a model called hypergame on graph to capture the asymmetrical information with one-sided payoff misperception. Based on this model, we present the solution of such a hypergame and use the solution to synthesize stealthy deceptive strategies. Specifically, deceptive sure winning and deceptive almost-sure winning strategies are developed by reducing the hypergame to a two-player game and one-player stochastic game with reachability objectives. A running example is introduced to demonstrate the game model and the solution concept used for strategy synthesis."

Material and Methods: Sixty-five human enamel blocks were prepared and the surface microhardness (SH0) values were determined. The artificial caries lesions were induced and the demineralization surface microhardness (SH1) was evaluated. The blocks were randomly allocated into five groups (n = 13): (1) 100-TGF (100% NaF with Tara gum added); (2) 50-TGF (50% free NaF + 50% NaF with Tara gum added); (3) 100% TG (100% Tara gum without fluoride); (4) 100% NaF (positive control); and (5) placebo (without Tara gum and NaF). The blocks were submitted to 7 days pH cycling and treated with dentifrice slurries twice a day. Finally, surface hardness (SH2) was assessed and the percentage of surface hardness recovery (%SMHR) was calculated. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni test was used for statistical analysis. Results: A positive %SMHR was found in the 100% NaF (5.07) and 50-TGF (0.64) groups, while the 100-TGF (-1.38), 100% TG (-3.88) and placebo (-0.52) did not undergo remineralization. Statistically significant differences were observed between 100% NaF and all the groups except for 50-TGF (p<0.05). Conclusion: The presence of hydrocolloid (Tara gum) promoted minimal remineralization when associated with NaF. In the applied model, Tara gum may have compromised remineralization, preventing free fluoride from acting effectively in the carious lesion."

However, nowadays it is widely used by many professionals from several areas and groups that are interested in understanding and adopting a different way of thinking and assuming life situations. This concept is called Computational Thinking. This research pursues the objective of contributing to the construction of a definition on computational thinking, as well as to the use of this term for educational purposes. The research is descriptive with a documentary design, based on the review of literature related to the subject, in order to properly specify how computational thinking is seen as an option for the representation, acquisition of knowledge and attention to problems, from the viewpoint of experts as ISTE & CSTA (2011), Papert (1980), Garcia-Pefialvo (2016), Wing (2006), among others. It was found that a definition by consensus of computational thinking has been the subject of constant debate within the scientific community, and one of the best options surrounding this kind of thinking is its incorporation into the mandatory school curriculum, from early stages or levels of the educational system, in order to enhance the children's analytical skills through the application of computer principles."

An examination of the shortcomings of the known equipment with the aim of its improvement was conducted. As a result, an installation scheme for continuous high-performance mechanical wastewater treatment was proposed. In contrast to the known equipment, the proposed installation provides a three-staged treatment of wastewater with the help of the two pairs of gratings - for preliminary treatment (removal of large-size pollutions) and by filtration through the two metallic sieves - for normal and fine treatment (removal of small-size mechanical pollutions). The installation consists of highly-efficient appliances for the cleaning of filtering elements in the course of realization of the working process, which provides stable high productivity of treatment. The installation has simple reliable design and low energy expenses. The paper contains the formulas for determining of main operational parameters of the installation: the change of the cross-sectional area of the filtering elements and productivity of the working process, periodicity of cleaning of gratings and sieves, the necessary electric power of installations drives.

In many modern control applications, one such objective is enforcing the safety of a system. The goal of this letter is to carry out this vision by combining event-triggered and safety-critical control design. We discuss how a direct transcription, in the context of safety, of event-triggered methods for stabilization may result in designs that are not implementable on real hardware due to the lack of a minimum interevent time. We provide an example showing this phenomena and, building on the insight gained, propose an event-triggered control approach via Input-to-State Safe Barrier Functions that achieves safety while ensuring that interevent times are uniformly lower bounded."

This study examines the consistency of the arousal strength of auditory elements that accompany exception messages available in two adaptable design options available for the Microsoft Windows operating system: (1) sound schemes and (2) desktop themes. The auditory elements available in these options differ in composition and sound features. Prior work indicates that such differences could result in differences in the arousal strength communicated by the auditory elements and therefore violate the key user interface design principle of consistency. The auditory elements within IT environments should communicate consistent levels of hazard as measured by arousal strength in order to achieve hazard matching. Results reveal differences in the arousal strength of the important critical stop auditory element across both sound schemes and desktop themes. Implications of this finding are discussed."

The methodology is based on a cross-sectional study, where relative and absolute frequencies were deduced, in the same way measures of central tendency and dispersion, thus the relationships of the variables were also analyzed through Pearson's Chi square with a reliability of 95%. The adolescents involved in the study had a mean age of 14 years, the majority 69 (53.5%) were male and 37 (28.7%) without schooling. Also, 102 (79.1%) reported low life satisfaction, 68 (52.7%) low self-esteem, 90 (69.8%) low achievement motivation, and 86 (66.7) low future expectations. A significant relationship was found between the variables sex (p =.011) and life satisfaction (p =.054) with future expectations. Likewise, future expectations were related to life satisfaction (p =.054) and self-esteem was related to achievement motivation (p =.004). In conclusion, All the psychological risk variables report a high prevalence of the low level, sex and not having schooling have a significant influence, reinforced by the condition of poverty in which they live. It is necessary to promote the psychological health care of this population through the implementation of the community mental health service in the Peruvian jungle."

This graph invariant is very closely connected to a chemical quantity known as the total pi - electron energy of conjugated hydro carbon molecules. In recent times analogous energies are being considered, based on Eigen values of a variety of other graph matrices. In 1978, I.Gutman [1] defined energy mathematically for all graphs. Energy of graphs has many mathematical properties which are being investigated. The ordinary energy of an undirected simple finite graph G is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the Eigen values of its associated matrix. i.e. if mu(1), mu(2), ..., mu(n) are the Eigen values of adjacency matrix A(G), then energy of graph is Sigma(G) = Sigma(n)(i=1) vertical bar mu(i)vertical bar Laura Buggy, Amalia Culiuc, Katelyn Mccall and Duyguyen [9] introduced the more general M-energy or Mean Energy of G is then defined as E-M (G) = Sigma(n)(i=1)vertical bar mu(i) - (mu) over bar vertical bar, where (mu) over bar vertical bar is the average of mu(1), mu(2), ..., mu(n)."

First, we analyze the distributed continuous-time algorithm over uniformly jointly strongly connected balanced digraphs in an IFP-based framework. Then, we propose a distributed event-triggered communication mechanism for this algorithm. Next, we discretize the continuous-time algorithm by the forward Euler method with a constant stepsize irrelevant to network size, and show that the discretization can be seen as a stepsize-dependent passivity degradation of the input feedforward passivity. Thus, the discretized system preserves the IFP property and enables the same event-triggered communication mechanism but without Zeno behavior due to the discrete-time nature. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate our results."

As a result. antibacterial drugs have become less effective. resulting in the accelerated discovery of available alternative treatments. including essential oils. The aim of this work was to intensify and promote the action of two antibiotics kanamycin. and colistin to fight antibiotic resistance thanks to the action of essential oil obtained from the flowers of CoricloThyinus capitatus grown on the Iblei mountains. To this end. a comparison of biological and chemical assays was carried out. The results showed a broad antimicrobial power of the essential oil itself and a great synergistic activity in combination with Kanamycin and Colistin against multidrug-resistant bacteria. These combinations increased the range of antibiotics. leading us to speculate that it could be incorporated into new pharmaceutical formulations for therapies of infections caused by increasingly dangerous bacteria. Antibiotic resistance represents an ever-greater danger to human health. This work re-evaluates the use of colistin and kanamycin thanks to the synergistic action found with the addition of a natural substance to pave the way for new therapeutic strategies."

Methodology: a search is carried out in which 45 articles published between 2013 and 2018 are obtained. This was advanced in databases such as Medline, Science Direct, Pubmed, Dialnet, Proquest, among others. In the same way, contributions were considered from experts in the area of physical activity and health promotion, where the following categories are addressed as search parameters: physical activity, music, aerobic capacity, and older adults. The articles examined included reviews, research articles and book chapters. Results: When we carried out the bibliographic sweep in articles of scientific research and book chapters, we found what refers to aerobic capacity, definitions, ways of mediating it; likewise, the relationship that music has when performing physical activity and at the same time, recommendations for practice, especially with older adults. It also exposes the benefits and risks of an insufficient level of physical activity. Moreover, significant improvements are reported in terms of reducing diseases, favoring the performance of activities of daily life, allowing to exercise muscle groups of legs and arms, thus achieving activities in which all parts of the body are used, such as walking, which becomes the main intervention strategy for the maintenance or improvement of this capacity and therefore allows to improve the quality of life. Conclusions: This review allows the reader to visualize the various concepts of aerobic capacity, measuring instruments, as well as their relation to physical activity, music, benefits and recommendations when performing it in different populations, but especially with older adults. On the other hand, the practice of physical activity accompanied by music has demonstrated in various investigations the benefits of practicing it. Even so, one must have control over the intensity, as any program activity, in this case by musical beats (psychological benefits (110-130 bpm) and organic physical beats (120-140 bpm), heart rate, Borg scale or speech test. Implement innovative activities such as the use of music when performing physical activity, creates a motivation and pleasure, which leads to life habits change and improve the quality of life of the older adult."

The process of converting the DICOM-RT plan to a deliverable trajectory by the linac control software introduces some uncertainty that is inherently incorporated into measurement-based patient specific QA but is not necessarily included for trajectory log file-based methods. Roughly half of prior studies have included this uncertainty in the analysis while the remaining studies have ignored it, and it has yet to be quantified in the literature. Methods: We collected DICOM-RT files from the treatment planning system and the trajectory log files from four TrueBeam linear accelerators for 25 IMRT and 10 VMAT plans. We quantified the DICOM-RT Conversion to Trajectory Residual (DCTR, difference between 'planned' MLC position from TPS DICOM-RT file and 'expected' MLC position (the deliverable MLC positions calculated by the linac control software) from trajectory log file) and compared it to the discrepancy between actual and expected machine parameters recorded in trajectory log files. Results: RMS of the DCTR was 0.0845 mm (range of RMS per field/arc: 0.0173-0.1825 mm) for 35 plans (114 fields/arcs) and was independent of treatment technique, with a maximum observed discrepancy at any control point of 0.7255 mm. DCTR was correlated with MLC velocity and was consistent over the course of treatment and over time, with a slight change in magnitude observed after a linac software upgrade. For comparison, the RMS of trajectory log file reported delivery error for moving MLCs was 0.0205 mm, thus DCTR is about four times the recorded delivery error in the trajectory log file. Conclusion: The uncertainty introduced from the conversion process by the linac control software from DICOM-RT plan to a deliverable trajectory is 3-4 times larger than the discrepancy between actual and expected machine parameters recorded in trajectory log files. This uncertainty should be incorporated into the analysis when using trajectory log file-based methods for analyzing MLC performance or patient-specific QA."

A main challenge in this approach, however, is identifying an appropriate decomposition function. In this letter, we show that any continuous-time dynamical system with a Lipschitz continuous vector field is mixed-monotone, and we provide a construction for the decomposition function that yields the tightest approximation of reachable sets when used with the standard tools for mixed-monotone systems. Our construction is similar to that recently proposed by Yang and Ozay for computing decomposition functions of discrete-time systems where we make appropriate modifications for the continuous-time setting and also extend to the case with unknown disturbance inputs. As in Yang's and Ozay's work, our decomposition function construction requires solving an optimization problem for each point in the state-space; however, we demonstrate through example how tight decomposition functions can sometimes be calculated in closed form. As a second contribution, we show how under-approximations of reachable sets can be efficiently computed via the mixed-monotonicity property by considering the backward-time dynamics."

Twenty-eight male soccer players participated in the study, being 14 children (Group 01: 9,7 +/- 1,2 years) and 14 university students (Group 02: 21,1 +/- 1,7 years). The players performed three games played with their feet (Rebatida, Bobinho and Artilheiro). The players' performance was analyzed using the Dvideow (R) software, which recorded the technical-tactical actions performed by both groups. It was possible to highlight that each of the game investigated, respecting their own organization process, presented the same technical-tactical possibilities, regardless of the group of players, at the same time that these disparate games provided different technical-tactical potentialities. Therefore, understanding the systemic organizational process of ball games played with the feet proves to be extremely important for coaches' better plan and conduct representative and challenging training sessions. The knowledge about the possibilities and potentialities of several small games, belonging to the culture of our street football, allow coaches to implement and monitor a player-centered and game-based teaching and training process, inspired by street pedagogy."

However, this research aims to explore the link between the international migration of the poor and the emergence of bidirectional violence, which has not been as addressed within the discipline. Accordingly, it is argued that the international migration of the poor is a potential catalyst of the bidirectional violence phenomenon- to the extent that those who migrate in vulnerable conditions have rational options for the use of violence as do the actors receiving the phenomenon, who take on social and fiscal costs.

Voluntary migration comes with numerous costs, both hidden and unhidden. These costs, without doubt, do vary from one individual to another. Taking an evidence-based approach with data collected from the United States' Department of State, this paper uncovers the expenses shouldered by Africans who seek Non-Immigrant Visas to the United States of America (US or USA). With over 80 categories of Non-Immigrant Visas (NIVs), the paper is narrowed to the most commonly sought NIV: the B1/B2 (business and tourism). This paper reflects on not only the increasing numbers of applications made over the years, and the financial implications these applications have on both the applicants and the national economies wherefrom they are made. Furthermore, it reviews the policies relating to US nationals who seek visas to visit African countries for business or tourism. As observed in the analysis of the evidence (official data), this paper argues that the payment of lower amounts thereof is indicative of a bias and lack of reciprocity in this regard, making migration to the Western world a drainage pipe through which African financial resources are collected."

Nevertheless, it neither has brought the much-desired intervention of the State, nor has stopped the legislative Autonomous initiative in this context, to which four new laws have been joined. This involves the progressive consolidation of a model that, because the Autonomous competency limitations with respect to professional regulation, cannot accomplish a crucial task in the system. That is the differentiation at the levels of professional intervention through the necessary coherence among the obtained qualification and the performed activity. Moreover, the existing Autonomous regulations establish some own regulations which are different each other about denomination and requisites of access to the regulated professions that order and exacerbate the configuration of a fragmented market. What is more, this regulatory heterogeneity obstructs the realization of the collective bargaining of national level in the sector, since required occupational trainings by the current collective agreement in order to practice the roles of their professions differ with those that regulate these various Autonomous laws.

The catalytic 1T'-MoTe2 was controllably synthesized via solid-state reaction and then facilely exfoliated into nanosheets by isopropanol with the aid of sonication. The overpotentials at 10 mA cm(-2)( eta(10)) can reach 73 mV with a low Tafel slope of 46.3 mV dec(-1), which are much lower than those reported by other preparation methods (eta(10) > 300 mV, Tafel slope > 50 mV dec(-1)). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy shows fast kinetics of 1T'-MoTe2 single crystal with low contact resistance of 0.3 omega. Additionally, 1T'-MoTe2 single crystal also exhibits large electrochemical active surface area of 47.0 cm(2), high turnover frequency of 1.02 s(-1) at 0.4 V and excellent durability over 10 h in 0.5 M H2SO4( aq).

We give some characterization theorems for almost bi-slant submanifolds. Moreover, we obtain integrability conditions of the distributions which are involved in the definition of almost bi-slant submanifolds. We also get some results for totally geodesic and totally umbilical almost bi-slant submanifolds of cosymplectic manifolds and Sasakian manifolds."
