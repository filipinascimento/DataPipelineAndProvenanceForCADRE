In this letter, we show that this framework can introduce equilibrium points (particularly at the boundary of the safe set) other than the minimum of the Lyapunov function into the closed-loop system. We derive explicit conditions under which these undesired equilibria (which can even appear in the simple case of linear systems with just one convex unsafe set) are asymptotically stable. To address this issue, we propose an extension to the QP-based controller unifying CLFs and CBFs such that the resulting system trajectories avoid the undesirable equilibria problem on the boundary of the safe set. The solution is illustrated in the design of a collision-free controller."

The question that guides the article is the following: What has been the importance of rental housing in the country's housing demand in the period 1950-2015, and how has rental housing been related to the more general processes of the city, such as poverty, inequality and segregation? To achieve these aims, the information on housing ownership contained in the population and housing censuses from 1950 to 2010 and the Intercensal Survey 2015 is used. The analysis focuses on the 95 cities with the largest population size in 2010. The main findings include the fact that the dynamism of rental housing in Mexico has not been significant, largely due to the housing policy established by the Mexican state, which has prioritized home ownership. The rental housing market is limited to specific cities and certain areas within cities, especially buildings and neighborhoods located in central areas. The proportion of houses for rent is related to the demographic dynamics of the city, the larger number of one-person households, the higher population density, its specialization in tourist activities and greater social inequality. There is also a close relationship between the life course of individuals, the cycle of families and the type of ownership in their residential selection."

In the proposed scheme considering phase differences, the collection time is balanced within each collection cycle by the phase differences, and the probability of load concentration to the specific time or node is decreased. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can equalize the loads of nodes even if the distribution of collection cycles is not uniform."

"WOS:000546866900001"	""	""	"Adjoint methods are used in both control theory and machine learning (ML) to efficiently compute gradients of functionals. In ML, the adjoint method is a popular approach for training multilayer neural networks and is commonly referred to as backpropagation. Despite its importance in ML, the adjoint method suffers from two well documented shortcomings: (i) gradient decay/explosion and (ii) excessive training time. Until now, the gradient decay problem has primarily been addressed through modification to the network architecture with gating units that add additional parameters. This results in additional computational costs during evaluation and training which further exacerbates the excessive training time. In this letter, we introduce a powerful framework for addressing the gradient decay problem based on second-order sensitivity concepts from control theory. As a result, we are able to robustly train arbitrary network architectures without suffering from gradient decay. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this method is able to speed up training with respect to both wall-clock time and data efficiency. We demonstrate our method on a synthetic long time gap experiment, as well as three sequential modeling benchmarks with a simple recurrent neural network architecture."

The MKP is a class of complex optimization problems that have many practical applications in the fields of engineering and sciences. Due to the practical applications of MKP, numerous algorithmic-based methods like local search and population-based search algorithms have been proposed to solve the MKP in the past few decades. This paper proposes a modified binary pigeon-inspired optimization algorithm named (Modified-BPIO) for the 0 - 1 multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP). The utilization of the binary pigeon-inspired optimization (BPIO) for solving the multidimensional knapsack problem came with huge success. However, it can be observed that the BPIO converges prematurely due to lost diversity during the search activities. Given the above, the crossover operator is integrated with the landmark component of the BPIO to improve the diversity of the solution space. The MKP benchmarks from the Operations Research (OR) library are utilized to test the performance of the proposed binary method. Experimentally, it is concluded that the proposed Modified-BPIO has a better performance when compared with the BPIO and existing state-of-the-arts that worked on the same MKP benchmarks."

The results were determined by means of descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation. These results showed r = -0.52 and -0.72 for boys and girls respectively, after correlating the percentage of fat and cardiovascular capacity. The correlation of their body mass index and their body weight, towards the percentage of fat were: r = 0.59 girl, 0.76 boy and r = 0.46 girl and 0.67 boy respectively, indicating that, the higher the body mass the higher the increase of fat The correlation between fat mass and the fixed bar test was inverse, but not high: r = -0.23 and -0.24. However, when this test was correlated with the body mass index, that correlation was higher: r = -0.57 and -0.78, reflecting that the body mass affected the resistance at the bar. Flexibility and agility were not altered by fat mass: r <0.20. In conclusion, it is evidenced that fat mass can decrease cardiovascular capacity and resistance to strength, however, flexibility and speed-agility may not be altered."

This situation changed with the introduction of Fellini's films in West Germany. Fellini was an important mediator between German and Italian culture as he and Giulietta Masina were promoted as an ingenious couple. The article considers the special situation of West German film culture in the 1950s, which was distinguished by a high degree of commercialisation. Film theoretical concepts such as auteur theory were hardly discussed. The analysis in this article is based on the examination of contemporary film reviews and marketing material. I will place Fellini's films in the context of the reception of Italian cinema in Germany. This also includes a comparison with other countries on which studies have already been presented. Fellini's rise to an auteur in Germany coincides with a fiindamental change in film culture. I will focus in the last part on this previously unexamined correlation."

Poor understanding of service characteristics has led to an undue reliance on branding models previously designed for tangible products. Although most of the researches have tried to modify their branding models to cater to the requirements of service branding, most of them are largely based on managerial and organizational perspectives. Few researches have attempted to highlight consumer's perspectives of what they consider important in a service brand. This study focuses on consumers' perceptions of important service brand associations and aims to be a stepping stone in the process of developing a specialized model for service branding. The qualitative information garnered for this research allowed digging deeper into the consumer's mind through in-depth personal interviews. The analytical method of coding, sorting, and sifting assisted in discovering the service brand associations. The results indicate salience of brand associations for consumers of service brands. The most frequently identified service brand associations include service environment and facilities, staff behavior, word-of-mouth communication, price, core service quality, experience (of the service provider and consumers), and advertising of the service brands."

Recycling also helps to reduce land, water, and air pollution as well as waste landfilling issues. The present work has been done to explore the prospect of partial replacement of natural soil for brick manufacturing with municipal waste, which is soda-lime glass. In this study, the effect of waste glass additives on the physical and mechanical properties of brick has been investigated. Bricks were manufactured using 2%, 4%, 10%, 16%, 30%, and 40% of waste glass replacing natural clay. Compressive strength, water absorption, and other tests were carried out to determine the mechanical performance and durability of the prepared brick specimens. An increase in compressive strength and decrease in water absorption of the samples were observed with the addition of waste glass. It was found that the developed bricks have been satisfying the parameters of the Grade-A and Grade-S brick in accordance with the Bangladeshi standard for conventional building clay brick (BDS 208). Results obtained from this study indicated that partial replacement of natural clay in brick with waste soda-lime glass makes the brick production sustainable and eco-friendly."

Popular statistics to indicate the strength of the prediction model include the coefficient of determination (r(2)), Pearson's linear correlation coefficient (r(Pearson)), and the root-mean-square error (RMSE), among many others. When a program calculates these statistics, slightly different definitions may be used. This commentary briefly reviews the definitions of three types of r2 and RMSE statistics (model validation, bias compensation, and Pearson) and how systematic errors due to shortcomings in solubility prediction models can be differently indicated by the choice of statistical indices. The indices we have employed in recently published papers on the prediction of solubility of druglike molecules were unclear, especially in cases of drugs from 'beyond the Rule of 5' chemical space, as simple prediction models showed distinctive 'bias-tilt' systematic type scatter.

Inclusion criteria were being between the ages of six and 12 years old; having degree one or two of necessary support (according to the DSM-5). The impact of the program is evaluated through a rubric system completed by two observers throughout all the sessions. The results are obtained by means of comparison of mean scores between both observers, establishing the mean scores on a monthly basis and performing the Wilcoxon significance test for related samples. The results show significant differences between the two measurement times (the first, at the beginning of the program, in order to establish a baseline against which to compare the second time, at the end of the program). A tendency of improvement can also be observed over time, with a slight stagnation between the months of January and February, and a slight reduction in performance at the end of the program."

After psychometric contrast, the study is based on the scale of attitude towards physical activity and sport. In addition, the research deepens in the measurement of the attitude towards physical activity and sport, and explores the existence of differences regarding gender and level of practice. A non-random sample of 1141 Millennial generation individuals selected with gender and age quotas was surveyed. The study goes forward with respect to the existing literature, suggesting a bi-dimensionality of the used scale. It also provides a predictive model for Millennial generation, based on the application of the logistic regression technique, with a high success rate to classify sport practicing and non-practicing individual. This glance at Millennials lays its value in the need of predicting future behaviors rather than comparing with other generations. In this sense, the development of attitudes that promote healthy habits, which are also beneficial both to individuals and the community as a whole is essential. Additionally, results show some novelty concerning particularities of Millennials: their attitude towards physical exercise and sports practice is better among women than men."

When making launches to hit them, which target is reached in the shortest flight time? This simulation was performed by 14 undergraduate students of Science courses at a Brazilian university, during a course about didactic materials. The students solved the problem by working in pairs on different computers, interacting with each order by a chat on the same program. The messages were recorded and were exported to sheets to be analyzed by the Rainbow Analytical Framework, which is configured as a tool for the analysis of argumentative discussions in Collaborative Learning environments.

This paper proposes and advocates possibilistic approach for travel time reliability computation of any type transportation vehicle under fuzzy type of data. The proposed approach is a novel way of computing the travel time & obtaining the related reliability value. Initially, the paper proposes the general methodology for travel time reliability evaluation. Individual travel time components of a transportation vehicle are considered as fuzzy; as a result, travel time is modelled as a fuzzy variable. Travel time reliability of a transportation vehicle has been defined with the help of possibilistic measures. The proposed procedure is then demonstrated with an application to marine vessel carrying the bulk. After illustration of the proposed methodology, sensitivity analysis is carried out. The paper ends with the comments on comparative features of the three cases."

For this reason, the main aim of this research was to analyse what content, objectives, competencies and resources are being worked in the initial teacher education of Early Childhood and Primary Education. For this, the teaching guides (2019-2020) of the Spanish Faculties of Education positioned in the Shanghai Ranking (2224 guides studied) were analysed. The questions to be analysed revolved around: (1) the conceptualization and dimensionality of coexistence, (2) the configuration and typologies of school conflicts, and (3) the structures of the integrated model of management of school coexistence. The main results showed a strong presence of some shaping elements of coexistence, such as understanding by other people and positive interdependence, but the presence was very restricted in terms of values of pluralism as constituent elements of coexistence. Although it is true that some types of school conflicts were founded in the initial teacher education, such as discipline problems, bullying or violence, on the contrary, the subject of vandalism, sexual harassment or plagiarism were generally non-existent. In the analysed degrees, different strategies, techniques and tools for coexistence management were found, but they were not included in an integrative model. For all these reasons, it can be concluded that initial teacher education should continue to improve in some specific directions."

Given the fundamental role that multistable switches play in both natural and synthetic genetic systems, here we focus on how the scarcity of resources affects the behavior of these elementary building blocks. In particular, we reveal that while competition for scarce resources pushes the dynamics towards monostability, self-activation attenuates this phenomenon, as well as perturbations from the genetic context of the switch. However, this robustness comes at a price: our analysis uncovers that strong self-activation can lead to tristable dynamics that can surprisingly and misleadingly appear as if the underlying system was monostable, especially when considering cell-to-cell heterogeneity. This letter thus exposes how self-activation and competition for scarce resources establish the stability and robustness properties of genetic switches at both single cell and population levels. Due to their analytic nature, our results provide explicit guidelines for the rational and optimal design of synthetic gene circuits and facilitate the analysis of organizing principles underlying natural systems."

Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is based on the combination of a non-toxic dye and an appropriate wavelength of visible light, which in the presence of oxygen is activated and can promote a phototoxic response. We would like to document a case of oral halitosis diagnosed and treated with photodynamic therapy using a 660 nm diode laser and phenothiazine chloride as a photosensitizer."

The results are ensured for strongly connected networks under fairly mild assumptions by introducing a minimum dwell-time between two consecutive switches.

However, it is impossible to undertake the scheduling and evaluation tasks unless previous information are available to predict the future. The grey model requires a limited volume of data for estimating the behavior of an unknown system. It provides high-accuracy predictions based on few data points. Various grey prediction models have been proposed so far, in which three different approaches are followed to increase the accuracy: (1) data preprocessing, (2) improved equation models, and (3) error improvement or error balancing. In this paper, firstly, a theorem is proposed and proved to recognize the parameters affecting two grey models, namely GM(1, 1) and FGM(1, 1). Then, the effective parameters are adjusted through particle swarm optimization (PSO) to formulate two adjusted models, namely IGM(1, 1) and IFGM(1, 1). According to the simulation results of the proposed models, accuracy of the modeling improved by a minimum of 14.24% and a maximum of 82.39%. Finally, the number of users of a public road transportation system was predicted using the proposed models. The results showed enhanced accuracy (by 7.7%) of the proposed models for predicting the number of users of the public road transportation system."

Ivermectin, an FDA approved antiparasitic drug formulated as a mixture 80:20 of the equipotent homologous 22,23 dihydro ivermectin (B1_a and B1_b), which is known to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with a mechanism of action to be defined. It draws attention powerfully that the energetic and structural perturbation that this drug induces by binding on SARS-COV-2 proteins of importance for its proliferation is ill unknown. Hence what we do an exhaustive computational biophysics study to discriminate the best docking of ivermectins to viral proteins and, subsequently, to analyze possible structural alterations with molecular dynamics. The results suggested that ivermectins are capable of docking to the superficial and internal pocket of the 3CL-protease and the HR2-domain, inducing unfolding/folding that change the native conformation in these proteins. In particular, ivermectin binds to the 3CL protease and leads this protein to an unfolded state, whereas the HR2-domain to a more compact conformation in comparison to the native state by refolding when the drug binding to this protein. The results obtained suggest a possible synergistic inhibitory against SARS-COV-2 owing to each role of ivermectins when favorably binding to these viral proteins. Given the importance of the results obtained about this new mechanism of action of ivermectin on SARS-CoV-2, experimental studies are needed that corroborate this proposal."

Material and Methods: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of each phytoconstituent was determined against Enterococcus faecalis. Five groups of antibiotic pastes based on zinc oxide were obtained by mixing: only terpineol, only cinnamaldehyde, terpineol and cinnamaldehyde combined, chlorhexidine (antibiotic control), and CTZ paste (control paste). Antibacterial activity was analyzed through direct contact test within 24 and 72 hours. Solubility was evaluated by spectrophotometry within 48 and 144 hours. Antibacterial activity data were analyzed descriptively, and solubility data was analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey tests (p<0.05). Results: The MIC obtained for terpineol and cinnamaldehyde were, respectively, 2000 mu g/mL and 500 mu g/mL. After 24h, only the terpineol paste did not inhibit E. faecalis growth. After 72h, all groups inhibited E. faecalis growth. After 48h, the highest solubility was verified in the terpineol paste (p<0.05), and no differences were detected among other groups (p>0.05). After and 144h, highest solubility was observed in the terpineol paste (p<0.05), followed by the CTZ paste (p<0.05). No differences were detected for cinnamaldehyde, terpineol+cinnamaldehyde and chlorhexidine pastes (p>0.05).

However, the uncontrolled extraction and use of groundwater can lead to contamination by natural processes or human activities. In this work, we studied the quality of groundwater sources in the Bokoya Massif, Morocco. During April 2018, a total of 96 water samples were taken from 81 wells and 15 springs distributed across the entire massif. Various physicochemical analyses of the samples were performed, including analyses of EC, TDS, HCO3-, SO42-, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, PO43-, NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, and Cl-. These analyses showed that the water samples were neutral to slightly basic and strongly mineralized. From a potability perspective, the main issues with the studied groundwater sources were their hardness (98% of the water samples were hard or very hard) and their high nitrate concentrations (36% of the samples exceeded the nitrate limit specified by the World Health Organization). The nitrate concentrations were higher in the samples taken in urbanized areas. In terms of their suitability for irrigation, only 41 of the samples (42.7%) presented water quality ranging from excellent to permissible according to the Wilcox classification. In addition to this quality problem, the flow from each source decreased by an average of of 73% during the dry period, with 24 of the water sources drying up completely."

"WOS:000544977200015"	""	""	"The paper addresses the time-old question of what is beauty. A rather ambitious, if not to say presumptuous, endeavour. But I do not aim high - I do not claim to get anywhere near unearthing the secret. Rather, I will use examples from mathematics, poetry, music and chess to substantiate one thesis: that the elusory character of beauty is not incidental. Its defiance of definition is part of its essence. The aesthetic sensation requires unawareness of its precise origin. Beauty is felt when some order is perceived, that is not fully comprehended. The order is too complex, or well hidden, or too novel, to surface in its entirety. This is the reason for our ability to enjoy a piece of art for the hundredth time - we never fully fathom its inner order. This is also the reason for the feeling of awe that the beauty inspires: mystery and magic are at its heart. I will compare mathematical techniques and features with those of poetry - like compression, summoning patterns from one field to solve problems in another, or self-reference, and show how beauty is generated in the two domains in a similar way. I will also comment on the beautygenerating effect of unexpectedness in both domains. That novelty generates beauty is a trite observation (the most expected feature of a poem is its unexpectedness, as somebody put it), but the question why this is so is not often addressed - I will connect it with the blind spot idea. In a final section I try to answer the question that is at least as difficult as what is beauty - why beauty?. The fact that it pervades our lives indicates that it has an important role - what is it? To arouse the reader's curiosity, let me summarize the attempted answer in one word - 'change'. That aim that is so coveted and so hard to achieve - a change in the pattern of our actions, aims and perceptions. The style of the paper is non-scientific, and non-erudite, reflecting my belief that scientific pretensions in the humanities deflect from softer, more genuine, understanding."

The system is underactuated since only one of the PDE systems is actuated. The design approach employs a backstepping transformation to move the undesired system couplings to the proximal boundary (where the actuation is located). We can then express this target system as a time-delay neutral system for which we can design an appropriate control law to obtain an exponentially stable target system."

A sarcastic sentence contains only positive words conveying a negative sentiment. Therefore, it is tough for any automated machine to identify the exact sentiment of the text in the presence of sarcasm. The existing systems for sarcastic sentiment detection are limited to the text scripted in English. Nowadays, researchers have shown greater interest in low resourced languages such as Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Arabic, Chinese, Dutch, Indonesian, etc. To analyse these low resource languages, the biggest challenge is the lack of available resources, especially in the context of Indian languages. Indian languages are very rich in morphology which pose a greater challenge for the automated machines. Telugu is one of the most popular languages after Hindi among Indian languages. In this article, we have collected and annotated a corpus of Telugu conversation sentences in the form of a question followed by a reply for sarcasm detection. Further, a set of algorithms are proposed for the analysis of sarcasm in the corpus of Telugu conversation sentences. The proposed algorithms are based on hyperbolic features namely, Interjection, Intensifier, Question mark and Exclamation symbol. The achieved accuracy is 94%."

In these systems, the vector field is the gradient field of a potential energy function. This fundamental fact about the dynamics is a structural prior knowledge and a constraint in the proposed identification method. While the nature of the identification problem is an estimation in the space of functions, we derive an equivalent finite dimensional formulation, which is a convex optimization in the form of a quadratic program. This provides scalability and the opportunity for utilizing recently developed large-scale optimization solvers. The central idea is representing the energy function as a difference of two convex functions and learning these convex functions jointly. Based on necessary and sufficient conditions for function convexity, the identification problem is formulated, and then, the existence, uniqueness and smoothness of the solution is addressed.

Material and Methods: In this case-control study, patients who were referred because of an enlarged thyroid gland were selected, patients who had undergone surgery for the thyroid nodule were included in the study. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and reactive protein C were measured before surgery in patients who were candidates for thyroid surgery. The histopathological records of patients were retrospectively reviewed. Relevant cases had a cytological evaluation of thyroid nodules by fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). The mean of ESR / CRP in both groups was compared using an independent t-test (p>0.05). Results: In malignant tumor type, in all patients, with Pill (PTC), analyzes in the malignant group showed a significant difference between the mean ESR / CRP in both groups with and without thyroid history. Sub-analyzes in the malignant group were significantly different between the mean ESR / CRP in both groups with and without thyroid histories (p=0.009) (40.16 +/- 28.81). The association between ESR and CRP, ESR / CRP and tumor size, ESR / CRP and age in each group as well as in the whole patients were evaluated using Pearson correlation test, which showed a positive association between ESR age and ESR (p=0.024, r=0.375). In the malignant group, a negative correlation was found between the age and the CRP rate (p=0.027, r=-0.441), and in the total patients between the age and the rate (ES=0.043, r=-0.256). Conclusion: Factors such as ESR and CRP, which are considered acute phase reactors and their levels increase in acute inflammatory conditions, may not have a significant increase in chronic inflammatory conditions and malignancies."

The approach is demonstrated on the fast-charge problem where hard constraints are imposed on problem variables to avoid lithium plating induced performance degradation.

Several therapies were reported towards identifying ligand against coronavirus, including targeting specific functional proteins or enzymes that are crucial to viruses, thereby preventing the synthesis and replication of virus RNA. Our study is mainly focused on targeting the virus's structural proteins, which could further block the binding of the virus to human cell receptors. In our study, we have selected nine Flavonoids for the inhibition of COVID-19 Spike protein, which have already been reported with their antiviral efficacies against other virus-infected diseases. AutoDock and PatchDock were used to study the inhibitory potential of flavonoids against COVID-19. Amongst all the eleven screened compounds, baicalin has depicted the highest binding affinity against 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein. Additionally, we have also compared its potential with two standard HIV drugs Abacavir and hydroxychloroquine, and the docking results clearly revealed the better inhibitory potential of baicalin in comparison to recently used drug Abacavir and hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19. Therefore our experimental findings strongly suggested that baicalin can be used as a potential inhibitor against COVID-19 spike protein, which could inhibit the interaction of the virus with the host cell and thus could provide a potential lead molecule for the development of a drug against COVID-19 disease."

It was previously shown that growth of components of physical function is related with an increased probability successful competitive performance. Suspension training is effective at improving components of physical function. Objective: Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the changes in physical performance traits of youth judokas after a 5-week suspension-training programme. Methods: Ten judokas (age, 15.4 +/- 2.8 y) completed a 5-week suspension training routine into their normal training schedule. The difficulty and intensity of the exercises were increased each week. Before and after the intervention athletes were assessed in the single-leg horizontal jumping, Sorensen test, sit-and-reach, Y balance, prone instability and handgrip strength tests. Results: Significant improvements (p<.05; Cohen d effect size e.2) were observed in the single-leg horizontal jumping (right leg: 137 +/- 23.3 vs 164 +/- 22.0; left leg: 131 +/- 24.1 vs 169 +/- 26.5 cm), Sorensen (134 +/- 43.4 vs 195 +/- 46.7 s), sit-and-reach (42.1 +/- 8.2 vs 46.2 +/- 7.5 cm), leg Y balance test (right leg: 91.3 +/- 6.6 vs 101 +/- 7.6%; left leg: 91.2 +/- 4.8 vs 103 +/- 6.6%) and arm Y balance test (right arm: 80.9 +/- 9.2 vs 89.3 +/- 8.4; left arm: 81.4 +/- 8.6 vs 90.0 +/- 9.6%) Conclusions: Lower-body muscle power, muscle endurance, flexibility, lower-body and upper-body balance physical performance traits were improved after a 5-week training period in youth judokas that replaced a part of their regular judo training with a suspension training routine."

A computer tool for evaluating the technical-tactical performance of volleyball players was developed. Through a computer program established in Microsoft Office Excel, which allowed registering and immediately accessing the necessary information during the development of a game. The variable of technical performance evaluation covers the following technical foundations, with their respective categorization of values. The tactical performance evaluation variable of the team was composed by the distribution of the raised, the technical efficiency percentage of the attack in k1 and k2, and the analysis of raised distribution and efficiency of attack by rotation. The program consists of 6 Excel books that work in an interrelated manner. The first five correspond to the sets played and the sixth corresponds to the summary of all the information entered. The match data were entered in the story sheet, to codify the technical-tactical situations of the game full. The sheets are divided into: Active (Final sheet, general sheet, difference sheet, atqefi sheet, atqk2 analysis sheet and summary sheet per player), Intermediate (Data and ATAQRSM), and Passive (Tables).

The purpose of this article is to analyze the existence of potential gaps between research and practice across socio-cultural contexts and suggest guidelines for future research and practice on motivational climate and attitudes towards physical education. In order to effectively create and disseminate knowledge, a broader focus on multiple contextual variables is needed which might help develop policies and evidence-based guidelines that reflect contextual intricacies across several socio-cultural contexts.

The planning horizon is divided into equally-sized periods in which minimal repairs, full replacement, or do-nothing actions can be performed on each machine's component. The machine reliability for preventive maintenance aspects, its availability for production purposes, and total operational costs for both preventive maintenance and manufacturing planning are formulated as the objective functions and the multi-objective model is solved using a simulation-based optimization algorithm in real case study.

We will first show some well known examples where PD tracking control laws do not yield tracking; some of which can even lead to instability. We will then show that for a subclass of robotic systems, PD tracking control laws, indeed, yield desirable tracking guarantees. We will show that for a specified time interval, and for sufficiently large enough PD gains (input saturations permitting), local boundedness of the tracking error can be guaranteed. In addition, for a class of systems with the kinetic symmetry property, stronger conditions like convergence to desirable bounds can be guaranteed. This class is not restrictive and includes robots like the acrobot, the cart-pole, and the inertia-wheel pendulums.

Motivated by biological and technical applications, we focus on a heterogeneous form of the model, where agents have different propensity to interact with others. By linearizing the dynamics about a synchronous state and leveraging an eigenvalue perturbation argument, we establish a closed-form expression for the mean-square convergence rate to the synchronous state in the absence of additive noise. These closed-form findings are extended to study the effect of added noise on the agents' coordination, captured by the polarization of the group. Our results reveal that heterogeneity has a detrimental effect on both the convergence rate and the polarization, which is nonlinearly moderated by the average number of connections in the group.

Three types of time delays and the impairment of B cells are involved. The Well-posedness of the model is demonstrated. Basic reproduction number of infection R-0 > 0 is established, which determines the existence of equilibria as follows; when R-0 is greater than unity, and then the model has two equilibria. Otherwise, the model has only a single equilibrium. The global stability of equilibria is proven using Lyapunov's direct method and applying LaSalle's invariance principle. To support our theoretical results, we have performed some numerical simulations in case of n = 2 where the model can describe the HIV dynamics with two types of target cells, CD4(+) T cells and macrophages."

These functions can be carried out by means of mechanical or intelligent devices. This article discusses a methodology for the preliminary design of passive prostheses (made up of mechanical devices) bases on data collection and the application of computational engineering techniques in a simple and novel way. Dimensional synthesis is applied by generating the path of the instantaneous center of rotation of the four-bar mechanism, the geometric configuration of which is obtained through an optimization process. The structural analysis of the prosthesis is developed according to the requirements given by the ISO 10328 standard for static and fatigue loads; obtaining part that are resistant, rigid and stable enough for maximum load conditions, with adequate reliability to the proposed performance specifications, and with a useful life of two years. The geometric modeling of the device is carried out according to the kinematic, kinetic and structural requirements; in addition, in its construction the arrangement of the respective universal accessories is considered for the alignment and assembly with the other modular components of the prosthetic leg. Finally, the extension assistance mechanism is designed by means of a compression spring capable of withstanding fatigue and static service conditions; achieving a moderate energy expenditure when powered by muscle power."

A recent empirical study has further revealed that such regions that share more common neighbors are more likely to behave coherently. To analytically investigate the underlying mechanisms, we consider that a set of n oscillators, which have no direct connections, are linked through m intermediate oscillators (called mediators), forming a complete bipartite network structure. Modeling the oscillators by the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model, we rigorously prove that mediated remote synchronization, i.e., synchronization between those n oscillators that are not directly connected, becomes more robust as the number of mediators increases.

From the density d and ultrasonic velocity U compressibility values, Ks(,), K-s,K-phi, K-T and W for the solutions, as well as for the solvents, are derived. Other acoustic variables like molar free volume V-f, internal pressure pi(i), relative association R-A, solvation number S-n(0), acoustic impedance Z are also calculated. Interpretations of these parameters in the light of molecular interactions are made. It is found that the compressibility of the solutions and the solvent decrease with a concentration of electrolyte and amount of d-sorbitol as a result of the structure breaking property of alkali metal ions and electrostriction of the solvation shells. The presence of strong ion-solvent interaction in the solution is supported by the values of the derived parameters."

For the machining system's uninterrupted functioning, an operating machine is immediately replaced with the available warm standby machine in negligible switchover time whenever it fails. The concept of threshold vacation policy: N-policy is also considered. Under this vacation policy, the server starts to serve the failed machines on the accumulation of a prespecified number of failed machines in the system. The server continues until the system is empty from the failed machines; after that, the server goes for vacation. The notion of an organizational delay, server breakdown, and repair in multiple phases is also conceptualized to build the studied model more realistic. The recursive matrix method is used to find steady-state queue size distribution, and subsequently, various system performance measures are also developed to validate the studied model. The optimal analysis has been performed to identify the critical design parameters for the governing model. The state-of-the-art of the present study is its mathematical modeling of the multi-machine stochastic problem with varied limitations and strategies. The methodology to obtain queue size distribution, optimal design parameters, is beneficial for dealing with other complex and sophisticated real-time machining problems in the service system, computer and communication system, manufacturing and production system, etc. The present problem is limited to fewer machines, which can be extended to more machines with different topologies with high computational facilities."

Materials and methods: The online matching correction data were retrospectively collected for 50 patients treated with the FAST trial. They were equally divided into DIBH and FB groups to compare between both methods in the setup reproducibility and create the appropriate planning target volume (PTV) margin. Ten patients out of the fifty were scanned in DIBH and FB to perform a dosimetric comparison with the strict acceptance criteria of the FAST trial. Results: All heart dosimetric parameters of the DIBH was significantly lower than that of FB (p < 0.001), and the lung V-30% of DIBH plans was significantly lower than FB plans (p = 0.03). There was no statistically significant difference between the two methods in the other organs at risk doses. To fulfill the heart and lung constraints in FB plans, the PTV V-90% was reduced by 3.4%, and three plans would not attain the PTV acceptance criteria. There was no significant difference between the systematic or random setup errors between both methods except the left-right random shift was significantly lower in DIBH cases (p = 0.004). The calculated PTV margins were (4 mm, 3 mm, and 4 mm) for DIBH group, and (5 mm, 6 mm, and 8 mm) for FB group in the anterior-posterior, superior-inferior, and left-right shifts, respectively.

It is obvious that the road-traffic noise has negative health impacts on the population in the cities. These effects should be reduced to ensure the sustainability of modern cities. The main purpose of the study was to compare the changes in the noise level in the mountainous city in 2012 and 2016 compared to 1990. A hypothesis was introduced that over the past 26 years, the level and severity of noise during the day and night increased along with traffic and the number of cars. In addition, a comparison of the value of the traffic intensity of passenger cars and trucks during the daytime in the years 2012-2016 was made. Additionally, the noise generated by vehicles during the day and night was compared. On the basis of the results obtained, it can be concluded that the level of noise during the daytime over the last 26 years has clearly decreased. The main factors that reduced the noise level were the improvement of the quality of vehicle fleet, directing transit traffic to the city beltways, as well as the local use of noise barriers. However, the level of noise intensity at night increased significantly. This is due to the increase in the total number of vehicles in the city and their high speed at this time."

The purpose is to study and evaluate the morphological changes in the lungs in animals with experimental AGP against the background of DM. In the experiment, 32 white rats were used. The main group consisted of 24 animals with simulated AGP against the background of CD; control group - 8 intact animals. The experimental CD was reproduced by intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin at a dose of 60 mg/kg. On the 14th day after administration of streptozotocin, animals of the main group were injected with 10 % filtered stool suspension into the abdominal cavity of the study rats at a dose of 0.5 ml per 100 g of body weight. Removal of material for histological examination was carried out on days 1, 3, and 7. For the morphological study of the lungs of rats under experimental peritonitis, the method of light microscopy was used. Micropreparations were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, according to Hart, by the Van Gizon method. Histological examination of the lung tissue of animals with simulated AGP against the background of CD compared with intact rats on day 1 of the experiment showed a tendency for vasodilation. For 3 days, the lungs of the organs were observed in the lungs of animals; the wall was thickened in the vessels of large and medium caliber, the phenomena of mucoid edema and perivascular edema with small cell infiltration were noted. At day 7, significant changes in blood vessels and bronchi in all components were detected in the lungs of animals; Perivascular edema and inflammatory infiltration along the interval septa were observed in animals with simulated AGP against the background of CD in comparison with intact rats for 1 day of the experiment in lung tissue. The wall of small bronchi was thickened by leukocyte infiltration. For 3 days, the lungs of the animals were observed full blood vessels of the pulmonary components, the phenomena of mucoid edema were noted. For 7 days in the lungs of animals found the expansion of the lumen of the arteries and veins from their full blood, thickening of the outer shell of the vessel wall."

"WOS:000587909500002"	""	""	"This letter considers online optimal motion planning of an autonomous agent subject to linear temporal logic (LTL) constraints. Since user-specified tasks may not be fully realized (i.e., partially infeasible) in a complex environment, this letter considers hard and soft LTL constraints, where hard constraints enforce safety requirements (e.g., avoid obstacles) while soft constraints represent tasks that can be relaxed to not strictly follow user specifications. The motion planning of the agent is to generate trajectories, in decreasing order of priority, to 1) guarantee the satisfaction of safety constraints; 2) mostly fulfill soft constraints (i.e., minimize the violation cost if desired tasks are partially infeasible); 3) locally optimize rewards collection over a finite horizon. To achieve these objectives, receding horizon control is synthesized with an LTL formula to maximize the accumulated utilities over a finite horizon, while ensuring that safety constraints are fully satisfied and soft constraints are mostly satisfied. Simulation and experiment results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed motion strategy."

Rao based on his 1945 'breakthrough' paper published in the Bulletin of the Calcutta Mathematical Society, besides providing improved estimators in conventional, adaptive, link-tracing, size-biased sampling theories, found applications in post simulation improvement of Monte Carlo methods, cross validation and non parametric boot strapping, particle filtering, stereology, data compression, Rao-Blackwellized Field Goal percentage estimator (RB-FG %), Rao-Blackwellized Gaussian Smoothing, Rao-Blackwellized Parts-Constellation Tracker, Rao-Blackwellized Tempered Sampling (RTS) and a host of others. In this paper, we shall consider applications related to improving of estimators in finite population sampling theory. Taking cue from Basu (1958) wherein he showed that the 'order statistic '(sample units in ascending order of their labels) is a sufficient statistic, Pathak (Sankhya A 23:409-414, 1961) in the context of sampling from finite populations,first noticed that 'any estimator which is not a function of the order statistic', can be uniformly improved by the use of Rao-Blackwellization technique. See also Sinha and Sen (Sankhya [B] 51: 65-83, 1989) who go beyond variance comparisons and generalize to convex loss functions. In this paper, we shall revisit some of the estimators in Probability Proportional to Size sampling With Out Replacement (PPSWOR) schemes and show how Rao-Blackwellization provides improved estimators."
