"WOS:000545434900005"	""	""	"In this letter, we consider a discrete-time port- folio with m >= 2 assets optimization problem which includes the rebalancing frequency as an additional parameter in the maximization. The so-called Kelly Criterion is used as the performance metric; i.e., maximizing the expected logarithmic growth of a trader's account, and the portfolio obtained is called the frequency-based Kelly optimal portfolio. The focal point of this letter is to extend upon the results of our previous work to obtain various optimality characterizations on the portfolio. To be more specific, using Kelly's criterion in our new frequency-based formulation, we first prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the frequency-based Kelly optimal portfolio. With the aid of these conditions, we then show several new optimality characterizations such as expected ratio optimality and asymptotic relative optimality, and a result which we call the Extended Dominant Asset Theorem. That is, we prove that the ith asset is dominant in the portfolio if and only if the Kelly optimal portfolio consists of that asset only. The word extended on the theorem comes from the fact that it was only a sufficiency result that was proved in our previous work. Hence, in this letter, we improve it to involve a proof of the necessity part. In addition, the trader's survivability issue (no bankruptcy consideration) is also studied in detail in our frequency-based trading framework. Finally, to bridge the theory and practice, we propose a simple trading algorithm using the notion called dominant asset condition to decide when should one triggers a trade. The corresponding trading performance using historical price data is reported as supporting evidence."

To fully unleash their potential, bioelectronic devices should be able to precisely respond to real-time changes in the environment to drive biological systems' response towards the desired goals. However, controlling the biological systems' response with bioelectronic devices is challenging due to the presence of uncertainties, stochasticity, unmodeled dynamics, and complex nonlinearities. Here, we demonstrate the promise of leveraging tools in synthetic biology with an online machine learning (ML)-based feedback controller to achieve a precise spatiotemporal response of biological systems using bioelectronics driven by an adaptive external sense and respond learning algorithm. The proposed ML-based feedback controller leverages the learning capability and low computational complexity of a class of artificial neural networks called the Radial Basis Function (RBF) network. Lyapunov analysis is provided to prove stability of the proposed controller. The satisfactory performance of the proposed method is experimentally validated by maintaining media pH using bioelectronic proton pumps."

"WOS:000550629000017"	""	""	"Many recent works in control of electric power systems have investigated their synchronization through global performance metrics under external disturbances. The approach is motivated by fundamental changes in the operation of power grids, in particular by the substitution of conventional power plants with new renewable sources of electrical energy. This substitution will simultaneously increase fluctuations in power generation and reduce the available mechanical inertia. It is crucial to understand how strongly these two evolutions will impact grid stability. With very few, mostly numerical exceptions, earlier works on performance metrics had to rely on unrealistic assumptions of grid homogeneity. Here we show that a modified spectral decomposition can tackle that issue in inhomogeneous power grids in cases where disturbances occur on time scales that are long compared to the intrinsic time scales of the grid. We find in particular that the magnitude of the transient excursion generated by disturbances with long characteristic times does not depend on inertia. For continental-size, high-voltage power grids, this corresponds to power fluctuations that are correlated on time scales of few seconds or more. We conclude that power fluctuations arising from new renewables will not require per se the deployment of additional rotational inertia. We numerically illustrate our results on the IEEE 118-Bus test case and a model of the synchronous grid of continental Europe."

This gas could reach energy densities close to 12 MJ/Nm(3), which allows its use as a fuel in conventional thermal machines or as a precursor for higher fuel gases. Given this, in the present work allothermal gasification for a 50 %w.t. moisture content biomass was analyzed computationally aiming to yield a high hydrogen content syngas. Using a power supply of 8 kW, the dry tar-free gas yield was around 51.9 moVkg of biomass with an average concentration of 45.7% CO, 44.8% H-2, 4.8% CH4 and 4.6% CO2. A peak temperature of 1,070 K and 33% for chemical efficiency were achieved. In spite of using homogeneous heating along the reactor wall, the process temperature decreases near the gas outlet. This is due to solid material depletion decreasing the process thermal inertia. During the final stages, H-2 and CO concentration also record an increase due to the endothermic carbon gasification as well as water-gas shift and methanation reactions."

The problem is solved for two cases of the absence and presence of cooperative advertising contract, and the results are compared. The solution to the problem is presented using the concepts of the Nash equilibrium, Stackelberg game, stochastic games, and dynamic programming. The computational results using numerical examples show that if the cooperative advertising contract is offered in the win-win condition, the players' profit will increase significantly."

Panel data regression models were used to test the hypotheses. The obtained results indicated that four corporate factors, namely real earnings management, predictable earnings management, institutional ownership, and board independence, have a significant relationship with the managerial entrenchment. In this study, the mixed index of managerial entrenchment is calculated using the principal component analysis based on four governance mechanisms of the percentage of shares available to the CEO, CEO duality, CEO compensation logarithm, and CEO tenure. This process has made the present study distinct from the previous ones, in which individual indexes were used for evaluating the entrenchment."

If the fall goes unnoticed or undetected, it can lead to severe injuries and can even lead to death. Detecting falls as early as possible is very important to avoid severe physical injurious and mental trauma. The objective of this paper is to design the fall detection model using data of daily living activities only. In the proposed fall detection model, an eccentric approach with SVM based one-class classification is used. For the pre-processing step, fast fourier transformation has been applied to the data and seven features have been calculated using the preprocessed ADL dataset that has been calculated from the dataset of ADL (activities of daily living) activities acquired from the smartphones. An enhancement of the chi-square kernel-based support vector machine has been proposed here for classifying ADL activities from fall activities. Using the proposed algorithm, 98.81% sensitivity and 98.65% specificity have been achieved. This fall detection model achieved 100% accuracy on the FARSEEING dataset."

Our approach consists of first reformulating the original problem as an unconstrained optimization problem using a continuously differentiable exact penalty function. This reformulation is based on replacing the Lagrange multipliers in the augmented Lagrangian of the original problem by Lagrange multiplier functions. The expressions of these Lagrange multiplier functions, which depend upon the gradients of the objective function and the constraints, can make the unconstrained penalty function non-convex in general even if the original problem is convex. We establish sufficient conditions on the objective function and the constraints of the original problem under which the unconstrained penalty function is convex. This enables us to use Nesterov's accelerated gradient method for unconstrained convex optimization and achieve a guaranteed rate of convergence which is better than the state-of-the-art first-order algorithms for constrained convex optimization. Simulations illustrate our results."

By showing a relationship between the variance of the attacker signal and how further away a node is, we are able to present a distributed algorithm that has minimal added complexity and performs the detection and isolation of the faulty node.

The most prevalent problems among PTSD patients are cognitive dysfunctions, including learning and memory impairments. Listening to music has constructive effects on brain functions, neurogenesis, and neuroplasticity, so the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of music on learning and memory in a rat model of PTSD. Fifty-six adult male Wistar rats (200-250 gr) divided into four main groups (control, music, PTSD, and PTSD+music) were used. A single prolonged stress (SPS) method was used for inducing PTSD in rats. Anxiety-like behaviors and Cognitive functions were evaluated using the Open field, Morris water maze (MWM), and passive avoidance test. Findings demonstrated that SPS induced marked impairment in learning and memory, and anxiolytic behaviors in rats and exposure to music significantly ameliorated these impairments. It seems that music can modulate the destructive effects of SPS on learning and memory at a behavioral level."

The animals ere divided into four groups (n=5) and treated orally for 7 d as follows: Group I (extract dose of 300 mg/kgBW): Group II (extract dose of 400 mg/kgBW): Group III (Phytantii extract and Group IV (0.5% NaCMC). On day 8, animals were infected with Staphylococcus aureus intraperitoneally and left for 1h. Blood was collected and assayed kith ELISA Kit for IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha Data collected were then statistically analyzed using SPSS. According to results obtained. the Callyspongia sp. extract effect in both IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha is significantly different from Group IV as the negative control (p<0.05). Callyspongia sp. extract provided similar potency between Group I and Group III (p>0.05). yet Group II provided higher activity in increasing IFN-gamma levels. In contrast. Callyspongia sp. provided similar activity between Group I Group II. and Group III to increase TNF-alpha levels (p>0.05).

Quality of life is an indicator of overall self-perceived health status. The objective was to analyze the relationship between physical activity, tobacco consumption, alcohol and quality of life using an observational methodology, randomly selecting 1037 Spanish adolescents aged 14-17 years old (15.52 +/- 1.11 years old). Instruments used were the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (physical activity), the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance (tobacco), the Questionnaire on alcohol consumption habits in adolescents (alcohol), and the Health Questionnaire SF-36 (quality of life). Bi-variant relationships were explored using contingency tables, followed by binary logistic regression analysis. Results suggest that physical activity (p < .001) is the variable that best predicts quality of life perceived by boys, tobacco use being also relevant (p < .05). In girls, both tobacco consumption (p < .001) and alcohol consumption (p < .001) are shown as the variables that best predict their perceived quality of life, but the association between physical activity and quality of life is less relevant (p < .05). The promotion of health-related quality of life depends on the creation of comprehensive educational environments where physical activity is part of a healthy lifestyle."

To achieve them, a cross-sectional observational study was carried out based on data from the last available Spanish National Health Survey (2017) of 7598 surveys answered by an adult living in a home in which the existence of a minor older than 5 years. The proportion of overweight minors decreases as the level of education of the adult is higher. Likewise, the number of underweight children increases slightly with the increase in the level of education of the adult. In general, minors engage in physical activity more frequently than adults (38.1% of sedentary adults compared to 13.7% of minors) and this frequency increases as the level of education of the adult is higher. Therefore, the results obtained show that Spanish minors tend to replicate the lifestyles related to the physical activity of the adults with whom they live. This makes adults the target population to influence primary and secondary prevention health policies to improve their health and that of the children around them."

The availability of many organizations in the cloud has posed a challenge for cloud users to choose a best cloud service. To assist the cloud users, we have proposed a MCDM-based cloud service selection framework to choose a best service provider based on QoS requirement. The cloud service selection methods based on TOPSIS suffers from rank reversal problem as it ranks optimal service provider to non-optimal on addition or removal of a service provider and deludes the cloud user. Therefore, a robust and efficient TOPSIS (RE-TOPSIS)-based novel framework has been proposed to rank the cloud service providers using QoS provided by them and cloud user's priority for each QoS. The proposed framework is robust to rank reversal problem and its effectiveness has been demonstrated through a case study performed on a real dataset. Sensitivity analysis has also been performed to show the robustness against the rank reversal phenomenon."

In this letter, we propose an analytical derivation of Population Balance Equations (PBEs) that can be used to compute the dynamics of the main statistics of the cell size distribution. We then explore how the dynamics are affected by different division strategies and by the two different perspectives of observation. To assess the accuracy of our derivations, we compare the analytical results with those obtained numerically and through stochastic simulations. The comparison allows us to establish mathematical relationships between the two perspectives of observation, thus improving our knowledge of how cells control their growth and proliferation."

The proposed control law for each follower depends merely on the relative bearings and relative orientations to its neighbors in its local reference frame. The orientation synchronization problem is first solved so that all orientations of the followers converge to that of the leaders. Then, a bearing-only controller is developed to achieve the desired moving formation. Finally, an example illustrates the effectiveness."

Calcium hydroxide, (Ca(OH)(2)), phosphoric acid, (H3PO4), and magnesium chloride (MgCl2 center dot 6H(2)O) with a Ca/P ratio of 1.5, were mixed as the precursor materials. The concentration of added Mg was varied with respect to calcium (Ca) precursor molarity as such Mg/(Ca +Mg) molar ratio was 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15, while the (Ca+Mg)/P ratio was maintained at 1.50 throughout the experiment. The influence of Mg-doped TCP on phase composition, chemical structure, and a functional group at different weight percentages were accomplished through X-ray diffraction (XRD), inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. Based in the results of this research, the presence of magnesium led to the formation of Mg-doped calcium-deficient apatite (MgCDA) at 80 degrees C and Mg-doped beta-TCP at 850 degrees C; the incorporation of Mg into the TCP phase causing an expansion of the lattice and increase in the lattice parameter.

Due to the involvement of the resistance genes, this phenomenon has gained an unprecedented expansion. Their accumulation and dissemination are facilitated by mobile genetic elements (MGEs) (plasmids, transposons, integrons, genomic islands) that can increase intracellular DNA mobility. In clinical settings, one of the critical resistant bacteria associated with nosocomial infections is Acinetobacter baumannii. This Gram-negative bacterium exhibits variate resistance mechanisms that enable it to survive in extreme environmental conditions and to evade antimicrobial agents. The enormous adaptive capacity and the essential role in the emergence of severe nosocomial infections lead to the need to study more deeply the mechanisms involved in antibiotic resistance in A. baumannii strains. In this review, we will initially present the role of A. baumannii in human and veterinary infectious pathology. We will subsequently discuss the main genetic resistance mechanisms (both intrinsic and acquired) encountered in A. baumannii strains."

To avoid the well-known issue on the unmeasured premise variables in fuzzy observer design, we reformulate the nonlinear systems in a TS fuzzy form with local nonlinear models. A particular feature of these so-called N-TS fuzzy models is that all the unmeasured nonlinearities are isolated in a nonlinear consequent. Together with a judicious use of the differential mean value theorem, the N-TS fuzzy reformulation enables an effective framework to design fuzzy UI observers. Based on an UI decoupling technique, no specific information on the UI is required for fuzzy observer design. The asymptotic estimations of both the state and the UI are guaranteed with fuzzy Lyapunov arguments. The observer gains can be effectively computed following an LMI-based design procedure. Numerical illustrations are given to demonstrate the interests of the proposed method over related existing results."

Leaf micromorphology and histoanatomy were detailed and recorded by optical and transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The histochemical results reveal classes of secondary phytometabolites such as alkaloids, anthraquinones, coumarins, polyphenols, and saponins. Cardiotonics, flavonoids, and triterpenes compounds were not detected. All concentrations of leaf extracts showed a significant dose-dependent and time-dependent apoptotic effect with more than 90% apoptosis of U937 cells and about 60% apoptosis of COLO-205 cells in 24 h of culture under 200 mu g/mL of leaf extract. In addition, the phenolic compounds present in the fractions of the sample contribute to its strong antioxidant capacity.

Moreover, the contraction-based framework allows us to extend the linear control performance metrics for analyzing the closed-loop nonlinear system behavior. The closed-loop system's performance is evaluated in numerical simulations under input disturbances and/or white noise measurements and its efficacy is compared to that using PID and LQG controllers."

Thus, the present study aims to investigate and compare the views of middle school students from four European countries towards PE, considering cross-national and gender variables. In this cross-sectional study, 1244 middle school students (635 boys, 609 girls; Mean age = 14.3 +/- 0.9 years) from a public secondary school in Croatia, Lithuania, Poland and Portugal, answered to a questionnaire about their: (a) PE attitude, (b) PE importance, (c) PE main aim, and (d) perception of competence in PE. ANOVA and Student t-test were used to compare students' views across countries, and to compare boys' and girls' views within each country. Overall, results show that the students' views towards PE were mainly positive but important differences were found across the students from the four European countries. In all countries, boys have a more positive attitude, gave more importance to PE and perceived themselves as more competent than girls. Regardless of the sociocultural context, this study suggests that there is a cross-national need to further explore the nature of the differences found and increase young girl's attitudes towards PE. Additionally, more comparative studies are needed with a broad range of sociocultural contexts to assess the extent to which this type of differences is present."

A number of techniques, such as proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) have been developed to derive such reduced-order models. In this letter, the problem of selecting the dynamically important modes of dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) is addressed. Similar to sparsity-promoting DMD, the method described in this letter solves a convex optimization problem in order to determine the most important modes. The proposed algorithm produces sparse dynamical models for systems with inputs by solving a regularized least-squares problem that minimizes the reweighted L-1 norm of the relative mode weights and can work even with snapshot data that are not sequential. In addition, the process of estimating the modeling errors and designing a Kalman filter for flow estimation from limited measurements is presented. The method is demonstrated in the feedback control and estimation of the unsteady wake past an inclined flat plate in a high-fidelity direct numerical simulation."

Methodology: A descriptive (correlational) study was carried out. A total of 82 schoolchildren (36 girls and 46 boys) aged 8 to 11 years old were studied. Weight, height, and waist circumference (WC) were evaluated. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated. The Korper koordinations test Fur Kinder (KTK) for MC was evaluated. Three BMI categories were determined (normal weight, overweight, and obesity). Results: Negative correlations were observed between the KTK ratio values, BMI, and WC, both in girls (r = -0.24 to -0.28) and in boys (r = -0.46 to -0.48). Children classified as normal weight had higher KTK ratio (121.4 +/- 29.2 points) than those classified as overweight (102.3 +/- 26.3 points) and obesity (89.2 +/- 21.3 points) (p <0.05).

Moreover, it was also verified, through the water budget boundary (percentage of water bill over average residential income), that scarcity prices are accepted as socially just, because this rate is below the affordable index of 5%, as recommended by the World Bank. The WSP model has been created for the Water and Sewage Company that operates in Campina Grande, but might be easily implemented in all other regions that are supplied by surface reservoirs and operate under similar water scarcity conditions.

Methodology/Approach: a descriptive qualitative research was carried out, using semi-structured interviews with 25 professionals in training from 11 different courses. To triangulate the data, semi-structured interviews were carried out with 5 professionals responsible for the Recruitment activity. Results: recruiters from more traditional areas such as Health, Law and Education are afraid to hire tattooed professionals, especially those who will have a direct service to the public. However, professionals in training use strategies to avoid suffering such reproofs, especially in job interviews. Academic Contributions: prejudice regarding the use of tattoos, which still exists even nowadays, confirms the findings of previous research on the subject, demonstrating that although this consumption has become more common, it retains an image of rebellion and insubordination. Practical Contributions: provides data to professionals in training, so that they intend to work in more conservative professions, so that they postpone the consumption of tattoos in very visible place at the beginning of their careers. For recruitment professionals, controversial tattoos represent more records of overcoming those who consume them than of rebellion. The overcoming characteristic indicates people who are, to a certain extent, more resilient and emotionally mature, which can serve as a reference for job vacancies that demand this characteristic. However, very conservative professional activities still require care when it comes to hiring a professional with very flashy tattoos exposed who will perform services to the public."

The susceptible CD4(+)T cells can be infected when they are contacted by one of the following: (i) free HIV particles, (ii) silent infected cells, and (iii) actively infected cells. The effect of saturation infection has been incorporated in the second model. The model is an improvement of an existing HIV infection models which have neglected the infection due to incidence between the silently infected cells and susceptible CD4(+)T cells. We first show that the models are well-posed. Each of our proposed models has three equilibria, namely: HIV-free equilibrium, D-0, chronic HIV infection equilibrium with inactive CTL-mediated immune response, D-1 , chronic HIV infection equilibrium with active CTL-mediated immune response, D-2. We derive two threshold parameters, the basic HIV reproduction number, R-0, and the CTL-mediated immunity reproduction number, R-1. These parameters determine the existence and global stability of the equilibria of the model. We prove the global asymptotic stability of all equilibria by utilizing the Lyapunov function and LaSalle's invariance principle. We have proven the following: (i) if R-0 <= 1, then D-0 is globally asymptotically stable (G.A.S), (ii) if R-1 <= 1 < R-0, then D-1 is G.A.S, and (iii) if R-1 > 1, then D-2 is G.A.S. We have illustrated the theoretical results via numerical simulations. We have studied the effects of cell-to-cell (CTC) transmission and saturation on the dynamical behaviour of the system. We have shown that inclusion of CTC transmission decreases the concentration of susceptible CD4(+) T cells and increases the concentrations of infected cells and free HIV particles. While the inclusion of saturation increases the concentration of susceptible CD4(+) T cells and reduces the concentrations of infected cells and free HIV particles."

We aim here to analyze the impact of the personal and family context on digital equity, to identify the teaching model received, and to know their assessment and perception of this model. The research is a mixed study of descriptive scope in which qualitative and quantitative methods are combined. Firstly, a survey was carried out with students from the University of Extremadura (n=548) and, then, online interviews were conducted to members of the university governance. The results indicate that students from families with a low educational level have fewer opportunities to use digital technologies. Virtual lessons, which students have received, have essentially been based on presentations uploaded to the virtual campus with asynchronous interactions. The negative assessment of distance learning is explained by the apparent reverse relationship between time spent studying and academic performance and by the lack of teachers' adaptation to students' personal and academic circumstances. In conclusion, the university must move towards more collaborative and student-centered models."

Multiresponse optimisation for permeability, volumetric shrinkage and unconfined compressive strength was executed to achieve soil geopolymers that satisfy the regulatory requirement as hydraulic barrier materials. This was done using a robust experimental design and the utility concept to prescribe a framework for achieving reliable soil geopolymers. The results obtained show that significant interactions between the factors (P(T)xL(T)) and (P(T)xA/P) affected the response characteristics and consequently the soil geopolymer performance. The aptness of the multiresponse optimisation was confirmed at 95% confidence interval, which revealed that the developed soil geopolymers can be used in waste containment facility under certain conditions. Evidence of the geopolymerisation process was clarified using microstructural analyses. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy supported the formation of N-A-S-H and K-A-S-H gels. Moreover, diffraction patterns for new minerals such as muscovite and crystobalite were formed, with the disappearance of clay minerals. The presence of aluminosilicate gel binding systems was revealed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The participation of clay minerals in the geopolymerisation distinguishes the developed expansive soil geopolymer from the conventional geopolymers developed for concrete applications."

The conventional method may not be able to capture the actual failure mechanics as these methods are based on simplified assumptions of the predetermined slip surface. Highlighting this real engineering problem, an attempt is made in this research to simulate different aspects of slope collapse numerically. Lagrangian particle-based continuum model, namely, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has been used to develop a three-dimensional numerical slope model to understand the failure mechanics of unstable slopes. Both homogeneous and non-homogeneous slope models have been simulated, and the time history of naturally occurring failure planes has been tracked. A distinct slip surface has been seen from displacement contour of particles, which portray the innate response of a collapsed slope. The effect of soil properties on the response of slope surface has also been evaluated quantitatively by the different combination of non-homogeneous slope models. Afterwards, two conventional remedial measures have been simulated, and significant reduction of run-out length is seen, which can put a spotlight on future mitigation strategy in geotechnical hazard."

As a result, literature resources on this topic are relatively scarce and there is a lack of empirical validation of the COQ framework. This study therefore attempts to fill this research gap and aims to empirically investigate the dimensions of the COQ and their impact on organisational and employee performance. The study also explores the interrelationship between each dimension of COQ. A set of hypotheses are proposed and empirically tested based on the 120 survey responses mostly from the Asian region. The survey data was analysed using SPSS through descriptive analysis, reliability analysis, correlation analysis and regression analysis. Findings show that COQ dimensions; leadership emphasis, message credibility, peer involvement and employee ownership encourage better employee performance. The study further suggests that organisations should work on ensuring supervision from top to bottom, accelerating information flow, creating autonomous working environment and getting staff involved in strategic management. In addition, findings show that COQ factors also interact with each other in varying degrees. The study therefore addresses an important research gap by empirically investigating the COQ dimensions and suggesting that from an employee perspective, organizational performance can be accelerated through quality culture management."

Stepwise-multiple linear regression (SW-MLR) method are employed for selection of descriptors. The selected descriptors are MATS7v,MATS6c, GATS3s, ATSC6i , C040, SpMin8_Bhi, E2v, JGI1 and Mor08u. Further details of the effective descriptors indicate that the electronic, topological and geometrical characteristics of studied pesticides are the most effective parameters on their AE on MWCNT/PbO2 nanocomposite adsorbent. Symbolic regression via genetic programming (SR-GP) is utilized to offer the symbolic regression QSPR model. The accuracy and predictive power of the SR-GP model are compared with traditional linear and nonlinear regression models containing multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). Inspection the fitness parameters confirms the superiority of SR-GP model over MLR, and SVR models. In SR-GP model, the correlation coefficients (R) are 0.930 and 0.890, and the root mean square errors (RMSE) are 0.04 and 0.05 for the training and test sets, respectively. These results can be used to predict the AE for other pesticides by MWCNT/PbO2 adsorbent and designing a more efficient nano cartridge for SPE."
