The qualitative analysis points out that the assessment made by the teacher on the aforementioned unit is rather balanced, as it contemplates all the DS components. However, while weighting the different DS items used to redesign the unit, the teacher puts more emphasis on epistemic suitability, particularly, on redesigning different tasks typologies in order to explore a broader significance of proportionality, in particular, the geometric and arithmetic ones. It is concluded that this type of result can be observed in other research projects dealing with the reflection that the teacher makes when using the didactical suitability tool."

However, access to electronic library resources appears to be lacking, and thus has become a major issue of concern among electronic libraries resources users, particularly the students. As a result, this study investigates the determinants of electronic library resources access in Saudi Arabia higher institutions. Specifically, it examined the relationship between two key variables and electronic library resources among the students of Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University. Cross-sectional survey forms the research design while the population of the study covered all the students in Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University. The sample size was determined using the formula by Tabachnick and Fidell (2001) with a sample of 128. The data collection was conducted using email procedure while the collected quantitative data was analysed using both correlation and regression analysis techniques. The findings revealed that the relationship between electronic library resources availability and electronic library resources access is statistically significant. Also, the finding shows that ease of use is statistically related to electronic library resources access among the students in higher institution. Therefore, the study concludes that electronic library resources availability significantly affects electronic library resources access among the students. Secondly, it is concluded that ease of use has a lot of impacts on the electronic library resources access among the students. The study offers several implications and suggestions for future studies."

The approach is more general than methods based on feedback linearization or backstepping as it does not require invertibility or the system be in strict-feedback form.

HpFP is an important techniques as congestion control scheme in a radio environment and video stream communication. HpFP has the character that throughput is adjusted by changing a packet transmission interval. We have already discussed some reliability models of a window flow control scheme based on a packet transmission interval. In these models, if some packets has failed at a first-time transmission, the packet transmission interval is prolonged. On the other hand, the server checks the state of network congestion by ECN bit. That is, if ECN bit has been set during connection, a packet transmission interval is also prolonged. We consider an extended stochastic model of a window flow control scheme based on a packet transmission interval with ECN considering packet loss. That is, the server checks ECN bit during connection and if the server detects the network congestion, the server executes congestion control that a packet transmission interval is prolonged. Thereafter, if a constant number of the retransmission has failed, or a constant number of packets has failed, the server checks it again.

The point of this study is to construct an effective palmprint recognition technique with low computational multifaceted nature and along these lines to expand the acknowledgment and precision. Since edges are free from distortion, they are very reliable and subsequently used for palm print recognition. The originality of the proposed technique depends on new area of interest (ROI) extraction took after by new principal line extraction and texture matching strategy. The new principal line extraction technique is created by using the Hessian matrix and Eigen value. The texture matching of the ROI is done using new 2-component partition method by segmenting the image into comparative and non-comparative edges. Examinations are finished on a database and exploratory results exhibit that the accuracy of the proposed method is comparable to past methods used for palmprint recognition."

Objective. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between the TSAT test, explosive strength, and 5-M line speed in national level TKD competitors of both sexes. Material and method. Through a correlational design, 14 competitors of both sexes who regularly compete in regional and national tournaments (age 19 +/- 3 years; size 164 +/- 10 cm; body weight 62 +/- 10 kg; experience 7.2 +/- 2.9 years), participated in this study. As indicators of explosive strength, squat jump (SJ) and countermovement jump (CMJ) were evaluated, as well as the 5-m linear speed (5-M) and the taekwondo-specific agility test (TSAT). Results. Among the main findings of this study, a direct relationship (r = .70) between 5-M and TSAT and an inverse relationship (r = -.63) between SJ, CMJ (r = -.53), and TSAT were documented, respectively. Conclusions. Our data shows that the TSAT test is related to 5-m linear velocity and explosive force.

The aim of this study was to analyze distance covered in passive and active game phases and its relation with number of points played and players' level. Sample was made up of 108 federated padel players (Average age = 33.81 +/- 6.72 years old). A total of 4406 points corresponding to 27 padel matches were analyzed through systematic observation with the SAGIT system. Matches were divided into three levels of competition: high level (9 matches; 1158 points), medium level (9 matches; 1352 points) and low level (9 matches; 1044 points). The results showed that padel players covered an average distance of 11 meters per point and 2900 meters per game. This total distance is divided into 51% active phase (playing time) and 49% passive phase (rest time). The mid-level players recorded almost 400 meters more in the active phase than the high-level players and almost 900 meters more than the low-level players.

The main objective of this study was to determine the effect of high-frequency whole body vibration (WBV) on blood [Lac] removal and heart rate (HR) after an all-out test. The participants performed a 4 x 100 m all-out test every 48 h in a random cross-over fashion, and a blood [Lac] removal protocol was applied after each test: a) 20 min seated (REST); b) squatting on a vibrating platform (S+V); and c) squatting on a non-vibrating platform (S-V). Blood [Lac] and HR were measured at rest, immediately after the 4 x 100 m all-out test (min 0), and at 10 and 20 min during the removal protocols. The results showed that the 3 protocols displayed significantly decreased blood [Lac] after 20 min (REST, S+V, and S-V removed Delta 6.6; Delta 10.5; and Delta 11.1 mmol.L-1, respectively). However, there were no significant differences in the blood [Lac] removal level between the S+V and S-V conditions. Interestingly, the S-V participants showed increased HR levels during the active recovery compared with the REST and S+V conditions. The effect of high-frequency WBV is not an additional stimulus to increase the blood [Lac] removal capacity in active young men, although WBV appeared to elicit less cardiovascular stress during recovery."

Many researches focused on the analysis of the development of metaphorical relations, images, concepts that evolve from myth to symbol. The metaphor in the literary text is not just a means of expression, but a way of thinking and knowing the world. The academic novelty of the paper consists in the study of the author's perception of reality through conceptual images that expand the boundaries of the metaphorical space of the text. The study reveals the ways cognitive metaphors function in the short stories by Lyudmila Petrushevskaya, also describing the author's individual style, the manner of understanding reality, the peculiarity of author's thought, her contribution to the development of metaphorization, and the expansion of the metaphorical space of the text. The author's interpretation of already known symbols, images, concepts is of great importance. A substantive base that forms a metaphor in the work of Petrushevskaya is also relevant, together with the factors that influence the development of metaphorical relations, those events or phenomena that are an incentive for the development of a metaphor in the writer's work. The paper identifies algorithms of metaphorical transformations, as well as metaphorical structure of cognitive metaphor, typical of author's way of thinking and individual artistic style."

"WOS:000549172700001"	"Yes"	"gold_doaj"	"Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA) is an evolutionary algorithm which mimics the process of music improvisation to obtain a nice harmony. The algorithm has been successfully applied to solve optimization problems in different domains. A significant shortcoming of the algorithm is inadequate exploitation when trying to solve complex problems. The algorithm relies on three operators for performing improvisation: memory consideration, pitch adjustment, and random consideration. In order to improve algorithm efficiency, we use roulette wheel and tournament selection in memory consideration, replace the pitch adjustment and random consideration with a modified polynomial mutation, and enhance the obtained new harmony with a modified beta-hill climbing algorithm. Such modification can help to maintain the diversity and enhance the convergence speed of the modified HS algorithm. beta-hill climbing is a recently introduced local search algorithm that is able to effectively solve different optimization problems. beta-hill climbing is utilized in the modified HS algorithm as a local search technique to improve the generated solution by HS. Two algorithms are proposed: the first one is called PHS beta-HC and the second one is called Imp. PHS beta-HC. The two algorithms are evaluated using 13 global optimization classical benchmark function with various ranges and complexities. The proposed algorithms are compared against five other HSA using the same test functions. Using Friedman test, the two proposed algorithms ranked 2nd (Imp. PHS beta-HC) and 3rd (PHS beta-HC). Furthermore, the two proposed algorithms are compared against four versions of particle swarm optimization (PSO). The results show that the proposed PHS beta-HC algorithm generates the best results for three test functions. In addition, the proposed Imp. PHS beta-HC algorithm is able to overcome the other algorithms for two test functions. Finally, the two proposed algorithms are compared with four variations of differential evolution (DE). The proposed PHS beta-HC algorithm produces the best results for three test functions, and the proposed Imp. PHS beta-HC algorithm outperforms the other algorithms for two test functions. In a nutshell, the two modified HSA are considered as an efficient extension to HSA which can be used to solve several optimization applications in the future."

The major cause of emissions of harmful gases into the environment is due to the high utilization of petroleum derivatives. In this way, it is paramount to explore environmentally sustainable energy sources for feasible advancement, to satisfy these expanding energy demands and to secure the environment. To mitigate these global problems, academic, industrial, and governmental sectors have engaged in a lot of brainstorming and research to surmount these difficulties, which have brought a steady flow of new information in the area of cultivation of microalgae in innovative technologies including photobioreactors and high rate algal ponds. In this respect, biomass generation from aquatic plants in enriched aquatic environments like wastewater has received considerable. Therefore, this review article provides comprehensive information on recent accounts on applications of microalgae in wastewater treatment using different technologies and their potentials in feedstock generation for biofuels applications. However, in the course of this study, high rate algal ponds (HRAP) and photobioreactors were found to be a reliable system for the cultivation of microalgae and wastewater treatment. Hence, the two-step method of dewatering methods is found to be the most effective approach for microalgae cultivation for wastewater treatment and generation of algal-based feedstock, taking into account high yield potentials and economic factors such as cost of operation and energy required for large scale algal biomass processing for biofuel generations."

The traditional systems cannot respond to the changes and customer's demands and for this reason, a flexible production system is used. Therefore, for this purpose, automated transportation systems are used for more flexibility in production. Thus, several AGVs are considered to perform various jobs among different machines and warehouses. In this production system, there are possibilities of failure and breakdown of AGVs and machines simultaneously. A modified rate is considered for determining the maintenance duration time as a percentage of the setup time when the maintenance time is dependent on the total setup time of machines and the total transfer jobs time of AGVs. Hence, we consider the probability of breakdown of AGVs and machines simultaneously and show the effect of these problems. The objective function is to minimize the maximum completion time (i.e., makespan or Cmax), the tardiness penalty, and the total transportation cost bearing in mind that the impact of new constraints with mathematical innovation on how failure and repair time are affected by the entire production scheduling. The proposed model belongs to mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Finally, several small-sized problems are generated and solved by the CEPLEX solver of GAMS software to show the efficiency of the proposed model."

Temporal correlation is modeled by a multivariable Gaussian distribution of the logarithm of the feedback gain values.

The removal of BPA had been concerned because human exposure toward BPA is widespread, and it is harmful to humans and the ecosystem. The aim of the study was to remove BPA by adsorption technique and understand the application of agricultural waste material as potential adsorbent. The increasing of the surface area of post-adsorption from 4.80 m(2)/g to 5.83 m(2)/g indicated that the sulphuric acid treatment responsible for the growth in the porosity of the banana bunches, increase the number of available binding sites and its ion-adsorption capacity. The highest removal of BPA by the banana bunch and coconut bunch was obtained in the following condition: the temperature at 25 degrees, pH 3, dosage at 100 mg, and agitation at 150rpm. The adsorption process was well described with the Langmuir isotherm, while the best correlation with the kinetic study of BPA adsorption was the pseudo-second-order model. The negative values of Delta H degrees suggested that the adsorption of BPA onto banana bunch (-13.748 J mol(-1)) and coconut bunch (-5693.67 J mol(-1)) is exothermic in nature."

In this study. an endophytic L-ASPase producing bacterium of the genus Bcrvibacillus from the root of Wycyrrhizo glabra was screened and characterized. After purification of the enzyme by ammonium sulfate precipitation dialysis. and silica gel column chromatography. anti-cancer studies were performed against M RC-5 (normal lung cells) and U937 cell (leukemia cell line). Additionally. optimization fermentation was performed in to s of significant ariables screened from a one-factor-at-the-time (OFAT) approach. The interactions of different experimental parameters were in estigated using the response surface methodology (RSM) ith the central composite design (CCD) algorithm. Cytotoxicity study showed that the dose-dependent effect of the L-ASPase at 100 IU/m1 had a lethality of about 80% against leukemia cells. Therefore the IC;, of the enzyme for leukemia cells was calculated to be approximately 33.54 IU/ml. Interestingly the cytotoxicity of L-ASPase against no al lung cells as only about 20%, at L-ASPase activity of G0-100 IL ml. Based on the quadratic model. the optimal fe entation conditions were predicted to be 20 glucose. 2% NaCl. p1I7. and incubation temperature 30 degrees C. Under these conditions the highest enzyme activity as 00 IL/ml. which had an efficiency of about 30% compared to non-optimized conditions. The results shcmed that L-ASPase isolated from Brevibacterium sp. M-R21 with selective cytotoxicity against the leukemia cell line may be a potential candidate as an anti-cancer drug after further study."

The activities included programming challenges using the Bee-Bot (R) robot. The study included pre-test/post-test evaluations using a control group. The sample of participants was 40 students from an educational centre, located in Salamanca, Spain. The activities were developed in the academic year 2018-2019. The collection of data on the mastery reached by the students, in the developed evaluations, was carried out using an evaluation rubric. The collected data allowed us to know the existence of significant differences in the capacity of the sequencing of actions in favour of the students who participated in the learning activities with robots. On the other hand, it was possible to affirm that no differences were found associated with the sex of the participants in relation to the programming and construction of sequences."

The findings of EFA resulted in ten factors of employability. Subsequently, CFA identified nine different factors: leadership, critical thinking, numeracy, sociability, using technology, planning and organizing, problem-solving, teamwork, and emotional intelligence skills. The values of CFA met the acceptance level of different fit indices and thus, resulted in a good model fit. Further, the internal consistency of the total scale yielded Cronbach's alpha value (alpha = 0.82). The threshold values of CR, AVE, and MSV also met the required criteria. Thus, it received a valid and reliable 26-item measurement scale of employability which can prove to be useful for academia, students, and employers in computer science and information technology."

"WOS:000545569800006"	""	""	"For years, there has been interest in approximation methods for solving dynamic programming problems, because of the inherent complexity in computing optimal solutions characterized by Bellman's principle of optimality. A wide range of approximate dynamic programming (ADP) methods now exists. It is of great interest to guarantee that the performance of an ADP scheme be at least some known fraction, say beta, of optimal. This letter introduces a general approach to bounding the performance of ADP methods, in this sense, in the stochastic setting. The approach is based on new results for bounding greedy solutions in string optimization problems, where one has to choose a string (ordered set) of actions to maximize an objective function. This bounding technique is inspired by submodularity theory, but submodularity is not required for establishing bounds. Instead, the bounding is based on quantifying certain notions of curvature of string functions; the smaller the curvatures the better the bound. The key insight is that any ADP scheme is a greedy scheme for some surrogate string objective function that coincides in its optimal solution and value with those of the original optimal control problem. The ADP scheme then yields to the bounding technique mentioned above, and the curvatures of the surrogate objective determine the value beta of the bound. The surrogate objective and its curvatures depend on the specific ADP."

Ameliorative roles of Ackee leaves and arils methanolic extracts were evaluated on mercuric chloride (HgCl2) induced-oxidative stress in D. melanogaster. 1-3 days old D. melanogaster were orally exposed to different concentrations of Ackee leaves (AL), and Ackee arils (AS) extracts as well as HgCl2 in a diet for 7 days. Subsequently, survival and negative geotaxis assays, quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and oxidative biomarker enzymes were determined. 500 mu M HgCl2 was selected based on the highest lethality, 0.2 mg/g for AL, and 0.4 mg/g for AS; they gave the highest antioxidant effects. Exposure to AL and AS plant extracts improved negative geotaxis behavior and extracts were able to ameliorate the effect of Hg2+ on catalase positively, acetylcholinesterase, glutathione-S transferase activities, increase total thiol and GSH levels and reverted increased nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide production (P<0.05) when compared to the control. Our results suggest that the Hg2+ mechanism of toxicity is associated with oxidative damage, as evidenced by the alteration in the oxidative stress-antioxidant imbalance, and that extracts possess essential phytochemicals that could alleviate possibly effects of environmental pollutants such as HgCl2."

On the basis of the conducted studies, it was revealed that different norms of sorbents and peat introduction into the bore mud decreased the concentration of oil products equally well; therefore, the recommended dosage of sorbents and peat at the low initial values of oil products can be 3-5%. When introducing glauconite in a form of flour and grain there it noted that the size of grain particles of the sorbent influenced insignificantly the decrease of oil products concentration in the bore mud.

This letter utilizes unique traits of tensors to devise a model-free situational awareness and energy forecasting framework for distribution networks. This letter formulates the state of the network at multiple time instants as a three-way tensor; hence, recovering full state information of the network is tantamount to estimating all the values of the tensor. Given measurements received from mu phasor measurement units and/or smart meters, the recovery of unobserved quantities is carried out using the low-rank canonical polyadic decomposition of the state tensor-that is, the state estimation task is posed as a tensor imputation problem utilizing observed patterns in measured (sampled) quantities. Two structured sampling schemes are considered, namely, asynchronous slab and fiber sampling. For both schemes, we present sufficient conditions on the number of sampled slabs and fibers that guarantee identifiability of the factors of the state tensor. Numerical results demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to achieve high estimation accuracy in multiple sampling scenarios."

All 146 myomectomy surgeries performed over a 6-year period from a single site are captured. Records were removed for various reasons, leaving 96 cases. Backpropagation and radial basis function ANN models were developed to predict EBL and perioperative transfusion needs along with a regression model. The single hidden layer backpropagation ANN models performed the best for both prediction problems. EBL was predicted on average within 127.33 ml of measured blood loss, and transfusions were predicted with 71.4% sensitivity and 85.4% specificity. A combined ANN ensemble model using the output of the EBL ANN as an input variable to the transfusion prediction ANN was developed and resulted in 100% sensitivity and 62.9% specificity. The preoperative identification of large EBL or transfusion need can assist caregivers in better planning for possible post-operative morbidity and mortality."

By using finite element limit analysis, a spherical cavity is numerically simulated under an axisymmetric condition, and the lower and upper bound solutions of the stability of spherical cavities can be obtained. For practical use, the results of the overload are displayed in the form of the dimensionless load factor, where the effects of three dimensionless parameters including the cover depth ratio of the spherical cavity, the dimensionless overburden factor, and the friction angle of the soil are taken into account. The influences of three dimensionless parameters on the failure mechanisms of collapsed spherical cavities in sandy soils under overloading are comprehensively studied and discussed. From the results, it can be observed that these three parameters have significant influences on the magnitude of the dimensionless load factor as well as the dimensions of the plastic shear zones of the failure mechanisms of collapsed spherical cavities. Note that there is no investigation regarding the effect of the friction angle on the stability of spherical cavities in the past, but many applications of the effect of the friction angle have concerned about tunnel problems; however, for spherical cavities, this type of shape is not really representative for practice applications of the friction angle. The results of the load factors and the predicted failure mechanisms can be used for several practical works dealing with the sinkhole problems under drained conditions."

His main method is called method of exhaustion, with results justified by double contradiction. This paper will compare the ideas and problems brought up in On Conoids and Spheroids and how they relate to modern day calculus. This paper will also look into some basic details on the method of exhaustion and how it allowed the ancient Greek mathematicians to prove propositions without any knowledge of calculus. In addition, this paper will discuss some mathematical contributions made by Arabic mathematicians such as Ibn alHaytham and how his work connects to mathematics in the seventeenth Century regarding sums of powers of whole numbers and the Basel Problem.

In this letter, a nested sparse successive Galerkin method is presented for HJB equations, and the computational cost only grows polynomially with the dimension. Based on successive approximation techniques, the nonlinear HJB partial differential equation (PDE) is transformed into a sequence of linear PDEs. Then the nested sparse grid methods are employed to solve the resultant linear PDEs. The designed method is sparse in two aspects. Firstly, the solution of the linear PDE is constructed based on sparse combinations of nested basis functions. Secondly, the multi-dimensional integrals in the Galerkin method are efficiently calculated using nested sparse grid quadrature rules. Once the successive approximation process is finished, the optimal controller can be analytically given based on the sparse basis functions and coefficients. Numerical results also demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the designed nested sparse successive Galerkin method."

The results revealed that in the contaminated site, the mean level of all the metals in soil and different parts (root, stalk, and leaf) of the plant were found to be significantly (p<0.01) higher than the uncontaminated site. Multivariate analysis was used to determine the distribution of metals within the study area. The trace metal contents from different parts of these plants were determined by the use of AAS. The results revealed that Urtica dionica L. translocated high amounts of metals to its organs, especially to leaves, so that translocation factors were much higher than one (1). However, these concentrations of heavy metals in the soil and Urtica dionica L were higher than levels specified according to the standards in UK and Germany."

However, searching for a control invariant set over the family of ellipsoids is conservative for systems more complex than unconstrained linear time invariant systems. Moreover, even if the control invariant set may be approximated arbitrarily closely by polyhedra, the complexity of the polyhedra may grow rapidly in certain directions. An attractive generalization of these two families are piecewise semi-ellipsoids. We provide in this letter a convex programming approach for computing control invariant sets of this family."

"WOS:000556633800005"	"Yes"	"gold_other"	"In this study, the effect of incorporating hollow glass microspheres (HGM) on the mechanical properties of modified concrete with CR (crumb rubber) was evaluated. Different concrete samples replacing 15% of fine aggregates (total weight of CR + HGM = 15%) were prepared. It was found that the increase in the microsphere content was directly proportional to the slump, compressive strength, and the modulus of elasticity. The increase in the microsphere content was inversely proportional to density. Additionally, we found that in the modified concrete, the width, height and the number of cracks increased as the HGM content increases. The combined sample HGM12.5-CR2.5 (the one with the highest content of microspheres) resulted in concrete with the highest compressive strength of 19.1 MPa, which is 243% stronger than the concrete with only crumb rubber (9.2 MPa). From the XRD results, we were able to detect the presence of different phases formed by hydration during the process of preparing concrete mixtures. The micrographs allowed identifying the fracture in the microspheres during the preparation of the concrete mixtures when they came into contact with the aggregates. The addition of hollow glass microspheres to the mixtures prepared from crumb rubber improved their mechanical properties, and this makes it a potential system that can replace the traditional materials in the production of concrete."

This work aimed to investigate the sorption efficiency of laboratory and commercial synthesized nanocrystalline zinc oxide onto raw coconut husk in a batch adsorption study. Characterization of samples was performed by employing spectroscopies techniques such as X-ray Diffraction Spectroscopy, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy, Transmission Electron Spectroscopy, Fourier transform IR Spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller. A spherical shaped nanocrystalline ZnO with a mean crystallite and particle size of 14.7 nm and 24 nm by XRD and TEM was synthesized as compared to the commercial ZnO-NPs of size < 50 nm. The maximum percentage removal of 88% (0.13 mg/g) and 90% (0.16 mg/g) for laboratory synthesized and commercial ZnO-NPs respectively was recorded at an optimum contact time of 80 minutes. The data also indicated 2.0 g sorbent mass and pH of 8 as the optimum conditions for maximum percentage removal of these nanoparticles. Both Langmuir and Freundlich models fitted best for laboratory synthesized ZnO-NPs with a maximum capacity of 0.797 mg/g, whereas Langmuir isotherm model alone with a maximum capacity of 0.710 mg/g fitted well for commercial ZnO-NPs. The n-value from the Freundlich model, as well as separation factor (R-L) were greater than unity suggesting a favorable adsorption process. The study obeyed pseudo-second-order, which was exothermic with a high degree of freedom of sorbent-sorbate interaction. The results suggested that coconut husk is potentially scalable for removing ZnO-NPs from wastewater."

It appears that patients with life -threatening tumors or immunosuppressed patients are at a greater risk of developing more severe symptoms induced by COVID-10. Thus, all patients should be provided with reliable consults and clinical treatment. The emergence of lockdown situations in more countries has moti ated all governments, healthcare services. and customers to further use on-line strategies in different areas with full access to healthcare. Telecommunications are beginning to be used in healthcare systems with the aim of providing a tailor specific approach to disease management. During the COVID-19 pandemic. antis iral drugs have failed to treat the disease. and no vaccine has been developed for the disease due to the pleiotropy and complexity of 2010-nCoV. Genome-base in estigations have brought new insights for the development of drugs to diagnose COVID-19 and predict its severity. In this re iew paper, we proposed a broad framework and interdisciplinary of telemedicine and genomic information for better management of patients and medical care professionals at different locations. By using a global telehealth network patients can be analyzed in a shorter time with lower costs. and better plans can be developed for the management of patients based on genetic profiles in different populations."

The instrument of measurement is the test devised by Casares and Collados (1998), which divides body values into 10 categories and it has been applied to a sample of 536 students from 1st year of Bachillerato in Castilla y Leon region of Spain during the academic year 2017/18. Two different procedures are performed to obtain results, by words and by body values. Also, in each of these procedures, both the maximum frequencies and the mean values are analyzed, eventually resulting in three different routes. The results obtained from the three methodologies show different characteristics and are not susceptible of comparative due to the heterogeneity in the units of measurement, however, the hierarchies derived from them do allow comparison in this regard. The most common trends linking students with contemporary Western society and post-modem body are examined. The results show pleasure value as the most fulfilling and religion as the least. Likewise, the biological, aesthetic, intellectual and affective-social body values are highlighted as the most pleasing after pleasure value, while the ecological, ethical and dynamic values are highlighted as less pleasant. All this, generally speaking, supports the perspective described by the literature about the postmodern body and its great value as an organic structure to the detriment of its human function, impacting on various fields that require intervention."

To detect true belonging of one pixel becomes a challenging problem while classifying mixed pixels in overlapping regions.

This newly implemented unsupervised model can detect cluster groups using hybrid 2-Dimensional Cellular-Automata model based on K-Means segmentation approach. This approach detects different land use land cover areas in satellite imagery by existing K-Means algorithm. Since it is a discrete dynamical system, cellular automaton realizes uniform interconnecting cells containing states. In the second stage of current model, we experiment with a 2-dimensional cellular automata to rank allocations of pixels among different land-cover regions. The method is experimented on the watershed area of Ajoy river (India) and Salinas (California) data set with true class labels using two internal and four external validity indices. The segmented areas are then compared with existing FCM, DBSCAN and K-Means methods and verified with the ground truth. The statistical analysis results also show the superiority of the new method."

This disruption brings a whole list of opportunities and challenges for organizations and the domain of supply chain management. Given big data availability, data analytics is needed to convert data into meaningful information, which plays an important role in supply chain management. One of the disruptive data analytics techniques that are predicted to impact growth, employment, and inequality in the market is automation of knowledge work, better known as machine learning. In this paper, we focused on comprehensively overviewing machine learning applications in demand forecasting and underlying its potential role in improving the supply chain efficiency. A total of 1870 papers were retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science databases based on our string query related to machine learning. A reduced total of 79 papers focusing on demand forecasting were comprehensively reviewed and used for the analysis in this study. The result showed that neural networks, artificial neural networks, support vector regression, and support vector machine were among the most widely used algorithms in demand forecasting with 27%, 22%, 18%, and 10%, respectively. This accounted for 77% of the total reviewed articles. Most of the machine learning application (65%) was applied in the industry sector, and a limited number of articles (5%) discussed the agriculture sector. This paper's practical implication is in exposing the current machine learning issues in the industry to help stakeholders and decision-makers better plan transformation actions."

It influences the biocompatibility performance of the scaffolds by increasing cell proliferation and allowing the transportation of the nutrients. oxygen, and metabolites in the blood rapidly to generate new tissue structure. However. a high amount of porosity can reduce the mechanical properties of the scaffold. Thus this study aims to determine the geometry of the porous structure of a scaffold which exhibits good mechanical properties while maintaining its porosity at a percentage of more than 80%. Circle and square geometries were used since they are categorized as simple geometry. A unit cell of 12mm x 12mm x 12mm for square shape and pore area of 25 pi mm(2) for circle shape was modeled and simulated by using Finite Element Analysis, The simulation consists of a compression test that determines which geometry exhibits better Young's Modulus. Since the circle geometry has better Young s Modulus. the pore size was furthered aried while maintaining the porosity of the scaffold to be above 80%, The same method of the simulation was done on the models. The result show s that the smallest pore size model has the highest Young's Modulus,, which still able to maintain the porosity at 80%."

One of the strategies consists of the World School Health Survey, which has been applied in different countries as a way to determine, in real time, the health situation of school children between 13 and 15 years of age, and from its results to generate proposals that help prevent its appearance, and favour the promotion of healthy habits and lifestyles. In Latin America, the survey has been applied in 15 countries and, in the case of this review, the sections on nutritional status and physical activity were considered, taking into account that our region has notably increased the indicators of excess weight (33,54% n=123,361) and sedentary lifestyles (41,2% n=123,361). Notwithstanding the relevance of the surveys, it is necessary to implement policies and guidelines that impact the educational system through mechanisms that guarantee the school population an understanding of the implications of good nutrition, accompanied by regular physical activity, on well-being and quality of life."

The proposed method searches for improvements by leveraging a PCA-based strategy similar to fish foraging. The strategy does not require explicit gradient computation or estimation and is shown in simulation to require few function evaluations. Additionally, our analysis proves that the proposed algorithm's search direction converges to the gradient direction everywhere outside of small neighborhoods around local minima. Applications to a data-driven LQR problem and noisy Rosenbrock optimization problem are demonstrated. Empirical results show the proposed method exhibits fast convergence and is able to find the LQR gains for any controllable system, including unstable systems, and is robust to noisy function evaluations."

It collects the information from physical sensors and stores it in cloud servers, and it can be accessed anywhere. Energy optimization is one of the crucial issues in sensor cloud as sensed information are unprocessed and directly saved into cloud server thereby increasing energy consumption and delay which leads to unbalancing in the network. In this paper, agent-based improved neuro-fuzzy optimization is proposed to avoid transmission of redundant information into cloud along with load balancing among all nodes for equal energy consumption. The agents work on behalf of node, migrate to each node in the cluster, collect information, and submit to CH minimizing node energy consumption. Neuro-fuzzy along with weights is used to improve information accuracy and reducing energy consumption to improve overall network lifetime. Result shows that less energy is consumed along with minimum delay and information with great accuracy is saved into cloud server."
