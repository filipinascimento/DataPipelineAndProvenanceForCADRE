While a majority of these historic results on set invariance consider flow conditions on the boundary, this letter fully characterizes set invariance through minimal barrier functions by directly appealing to a comparison result to define a flow condition over the entire domain of the system. A considerable benefit of this approach is the removal of regularity assumptions of the barrier function. This letter also outlines necessary and sufficient conditions for a valid differential inequality condition, giving the minimum conditions for this type of approach. We also show when minimal barrier functions are necessary and sufficient for set invariance."	"This work was supported by NSF under Award 1544332 and Award 1749357. Recommended by Senior Editor S.

The field performance can be monitored (indirectly) by observing the degradation of the quality characteristics of a product. This paper considers the gamma process to model the degradation behavior of the product characteristics. An integrated Bayesian approach is proposed to estimate the remaining useful life that considers accelerated degradation data to model degradation behavior first. The proposed approach also considers interaction effects in a multi-stress scenario impacting the degradation process. To reduces the computational complexity, posterior distributions are estimated using the MCMC simulation technique. The proposed method has been demonstrated with an LED case example and results show the superiority of Bayesian-based RUL estimation."

Through a statistical study, based on data at the municipal level, the main hypotheses suggested by the literature are examined to understand collection levels. In other words, the explanatory capacity of economic, political, and administrative factors is evaluated. On the one hand, the article analyzes the way both the socioeconomic variables of the municipality, and the amount of transfers they receive, influence tax collection. In addition, on the other, it analyzes whether the institutional capacity of the municipality and the level of political competition influence the amount collected from property. The findings indicate that municipalities facing the greatest electoral competition tend not to increase property tax collection; that the institutional capacity of treasuries and land registers is also an influential factor; and that the richer and more urban the municipality, the more it collects. Finally, it is found that intergovernmental fiscal transfers have not discouraged property tax collection."

In addition to various logistical supports, two other types of supports were identified: supports for learning and unlearning ways of perceiving the world generally and perceiving Western mathematics specifically. These needed supports came to light when we mentored the teachers. On the one hand, the co-researching teachers learned, or had already learned: (a) the plurality of mathematical systems; (b) the perspective of Western mathematics as a human endeavor along with its values, ideologies, and definitions; (c) the mere inclusion of Indigenous mathematizing in a lesson is not enough; and (d) the goal of two-eyed seeing. On the other hand, the co-researching teachers unlearned, or had already unlearned: (a) pure mathematics' claim to be value-free, (b) all students have a predilection to excel at mathematics, and (c) subtle appropriation committed by many mathematics educators as if it were common sense to do it."

Motivated by the study of Open Multi-Agent Systems, we concentrate on Randomly Induced Discretized Laplacians, a family of update matrices that are generated by sampling subgraphs of a large undirected graph. For these matrices, we express the bounds by using the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the underlying graph or the graph's average effective resistance, thereby proving their tightness.

Therefore, the identification of AD by analyzing blood gene expression may ameliorate the early diagnosis of the AD. We aimed to identify common genes commonly deregulated in blood and brain in AD. Comprehensive analysis of blood and brain gene expression datasets of AD, eQTL, and epigenetics data was analyzed by the integrative bioinformatics approach. The integrative analysis showed nine differentially expressed genes common to blood cells and brain (CNBD1, SUCLG2-AS1, CCDC65, PDE4D, MTMR1, C3, SLC6A15, LINC01806, and FRG1JP). Analysis of SNP and cis-eQTL data showed 18 genes; namely, HSD17B1, GAS5, RPS5, VKORC1, GLE1, WDR1, RPL12, MORN1, RAD52, SDR39U1, NPHP4, MT1E, SORD, LINC00638, MCM3AP-AS1, GSDMD, RPS9, and GNL2 were observed deregulated AD blood and brain tissues. Functional gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated a significant association of these genes in neurodegeneration-associated molecular pathways. Integrative biomolecular networks revealed dysregulation of several hub transcription factors and microRNAs in AD. Moreover, hub genes were observed associated with significant histone modification.

Likewise, some considerations are specifically needed if the research is carried out in an educational context and in different schools. This work aims to describe y the evaluation protocol of the research study entitled: PACO Study Cycle and Walk to School. In addition, it provides global recommendations and practical applications in the educational context. The main objective of the PACO Study is to promote the behaviour of active commuting among students of Compulsory Secondary Education to improve their physical activity levels and other associated health indicators. For this reason, the evaluation protocol includes the specific methodology and instruments for evaluating variables such as: 1) mode of commuting to school and other psychosocial factors associated with active commuting through the PACO student questionnaire, 2) family bathers to active commuting to school through the PACO families questionnaire, 3) anthropometric characteristics (weight, height, waist and neck circumference), 4) levels of physical activity and energy expenditure evaluated by accelerometry and 5) characteristics of the real home-school route through a Global Positioning System. The transparency in the methodology and logistic necessary to evaluate the variables in the educational context is key to evaluate the rigor and homogeneity in future implementations, whether they are carried out by researchers or teachers.

Twenty women (age 66 +/- 7) participated in this study. A group of ten women participated in 24 yoga sessions and a control group remained without any treatment. Heart Rate Variability was evaluated considering values of laRMSSD (natural logarithm of the square of the mean root of RR intervals) and lnSDNN (natural logarithm of the standard deviation of RR intervals), the perception of pain (Catastrophism Scale before Pain; PCS), and blood pressure through MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure) and PP (Pulse Pressure), each being measured in four study times. The results show that the autonomic assessment of lnRMSSD and lnSDNN is increased by the performance of Yoga at t3 and t4, and the perception of pain decreases at t4 when comparing both groups. Interestingly, these effects persist 30 days after the exercise time has ended. In conclusion, the group that practiced Hatha-vinyasa yoga decreased pain perception and improved autonomic regulation compared to the control group, being able to perceive its effect even 30 days after finishing thetreatment."

The implementation of contemporary models such as the non-linear pedagogy understand the teaching-learning process as a complex and nonlinear system, in which students, group-classroom, environment and teachers interact between each other, therefore negotiating the barriers of the acquisition of motor skills. Objective: The aim of this study was to design, implement and observe the motor response to a volleyball Didactic Unit based on non-linear pedagogy principles, such as the modification of the rules, size of the game area or material used. Methods: 66 students participated in this experience (age= 14.8 +/- 0.3 years old). All of them performed a self-assessment of this practice and we also collected some observations. We encouraged the students' participation through the variability, the use of uncertainty activities, learning exploration, creativity and decision-making. Results: We observed the expected students' motor response to the modification of constraints without giving specific instructions addressed to what they should perform. There was a high significant correlation between the knowledge of the game and the self-perception competence of the pass (r=0.366, p=0.004), the reception (r=0..266, p=0.040), serve (r=0.376, p=0.003), colocation of the body (r=0.413, p=0.001), and attack and block (r=0.267, p=0.038). Conclusions: Through the implementation of non-linear pedagogy, we observed that the students improved their autonomy and decision making. We also observed multiple interactions among the students in order to optimize their response to the constrictions applied."

Researchers have developed other in-host models to investigate HIV dynamics in the human body. In this paper, a mathematical model for the HIV infection of CD4(+) T cells is analyzed. We consider the proliferation of T cells in this study. It is found that there exist two equilibrium states for this model: Infection-free equilibrium state and infected equilibrium state. Local stability is discussed for both infection-free and infected equilibrium states using Routh-Hurwitz criteria. Also, we calculate the basic reproduction number (R-0) for the model with the help of next generation matrix method. The global stability of the infection-free equilibrium point is discussed using Lyapunov's second method. From the stability analysis, it is found that if basic reproduction number R-0 <= 1, infection of HIV is cleared out, and if R-0 > 1, infection of HIV persists. The conditions for global stability of the infected equilibrium point are derived using a geometric approach. We find a parameter region where the infected equilibrium point is globally stable. We carry out numerical simulations to verify the results. Also, the effects of the proliferation rate of uninfected CD4(+) T cells and recovery rate of infected CD4(+) T cells in dynamics of the T cells and free virus are studied using numerical simulations. It is found that small variations of these parameters can change the model's whole dynamics, and infection can be controlled by controlling the proliferation rate and improving the recovery rate."

This provides an unprecedented means for investigating cell mechanobiology, cell-matrix interactions, tissue biomechanics and other fundamental biological questions. Recent advances in optical hardware have accelerated the development of BI techniques, with increasingly finer spectral resolution and more powerful system capabilities. We envision that further developments will enable the translation of BI to clinical applications in disease screening and monitoring. In light of the recent shift towards biomedical applications, this review summarizes the state-of-the-art in Brillouin microscopy and imaging techniques with a specific focus on biological tissue and cell measurements.

The objective of this research was to interpret the perception and attribution of the students about the positive emotions for the subjective well-being during the practice of basketball in Physical Education, depending on the type of motor task, gender and educational center. To approach the emotional phenomenon, it has been decided to use a qualitative methodology. 20 girls and 24 boys from two educational centers in the Community of Madrid participated. The data was collected through semi-structured interviews and personal diaries, which have been subjected to a deductive-inductive content analysis with the help of the Atlas.ti 7.5 software. The results indicated 18 emotional codes or attributions found for joy, enthusiasm, security and fun. According to the type of motor task, gender and educational center, differences and similarities are identified, highlighting the role of competition and the relationship with a basketball sports culture in each educational center. It is concluded that, to promote the subjective well-being of the students in the practices of basketball in Physical Education, it could be appropriate to apply alternative teaching models of sport, adaptive strategies and a climate of achievement oriented to the task."

Multi criteria analysis involves solving inadequately structured problems, while in practical terms it is a necessary tool in solving the day-to-day tasks of decision-making, management actions, both at the design level and the exploitation of complex energy and process systems. The development of new methods and the improvement of existing multi criteria analysis methods have influenced their increasing application in the field of energy, from both theoretical and practical aspects. A particular segment of the application of multi criteria analysis methods is to make strategic or operational decisions when solving multidisciplinary problems with predominantly technical or predominantly economic content, whether looking at a part or the energy system as a whole. The application of these methods in choosing the right solutions in the decision-making tasks of management in the design, maintenance and operation of thermal power plants is based on the development of information technology and computer technology. There are several methods in use today, of which the following should be emphasized: PROMETHEE (Preference Ranking Organization METHod of Enrichment Evaluation), AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process), IKOR, ELECTRE (ELimination Et Choice Translating REality), MAX-MIN, MAX-MAX, Hurwicz (combination of max-max and max-min methods), SAW (Simple Additive Weighting Method), TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution), conjunctive method, disjunctive method, etc. Depending on the method used, the ranking of alternatives or criteria, the best alternative or criterion or set of alternatives or criteria that meet certain conditions is obtained as a solution. Problems that can be considered using multi-criteria decision-making have certain common characteristics: a large number of criteria that must be created by the decision maker, a high likelihood of conflict between the criteria, inseparable (different) units of measure (as a rule, each criterion has different units of measure), as well as design or the choice of optimal concepts in a predetermined space. Solutions are either designing the best alternative or choosing the best action from a set of predefined final actions. This paper provides a brief description of the more important methods, along with an analysis of their advantages and disadvantages, as well as the possibility of applying them to solve the specific problem of choosing a micro location for TPP. Starting from the application of the modified multi criteria method for determining the priorities between individual alternatives for ranking and selecting the optimal micro location within a certain macro location within a predetermined framework, in a decision situation involving a number of decision makers of different specialty, examples of micro location selection for new thermal power facilities of TPP Stanari are given, TPP Gacko 2 and TPP Ugljevik 3, with preliminary definition of elimination criteria and criteria for comparison of locations of given TPPs."

This paradigm shift justifies the positioning of brands in digital media platforms like Facebook, which provide an ideal platform for direct non-stop communication between organisations and customers. This builds a strong association between brands and consumers thereby generating brand trust through the sharing of consumer experiences and a positive word of mouth. Consumers do not make hasty decisions where there is the involvement of money, therefore trust plays a huge role in the usage of the services provided by eWallets. This study aims to investigate the effect of customer engagement through Facebook fan page usage on brand trust and purchase intentions. Results have revealed that consumer engagement through Facebook fan page usage generates trust for the eWallet brand in turn affecting purchase intentions indicating that Facebook fan pages can be utilised as an effective marketing tool."

This letter enables risk-trading in the chance-constrained stochastic electricity market by introducing Arrow-Debreu Securities (ADS) and derives a risk-averse market-clearing model with risk trading. To enable risk trading, the probability space of underlying uncertainty is discretized in a finite number of outcomes, which makes it possible to design practical risk contracts and to produce energy, balancing reserve and risk prices. Notably, although risk contracts are discrete, the model preserves the continuity of chance constraints. The case study illustrates the usefulness of the proposed risk-averse chance-constrained electricity market with risk trading."

To increase the social acceptance and to reduce the conflicts between users, citizens' preferences towards ecosystem services should be included in the decision-making process. In the present study, a structured questionnaire was administered to a sample of 180 citizens and 50 forest managers of the Tlemcen peri-urban forest (Algeria). The collected data was processed to show convergent and different preferences between forest managers and citizens towards the main categories of ecosystem services - provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services - provided by the Tlemcen pen-urban forest. The results show that for both groups of respondents the three most important ecosystem services are: tourism and recreation (cultural services), soil erosion protection (regulating services), and biodiversity conservation (supporting services). Conversely, provisioning services (wood and non-wood forest products) are considered marginal by the two groups of respondents. These results are in line with international literature, which highlights in post-modern society an increase in importance of intrinsic values of nature at the expense of instrumental values.

Our results in the course of this monitoring show bluer-when-brighter color changes, significant variability amplitude (almost a magnitude on a month time-scale) and the rare, but prominent intra-night variability. Standard stars have been also calibrated in the field of this object as a part of this work. Our results suggest that the variability behavior is more typical for an LSP (but perhaps not a FSRQ) than for a HSP blazar."

The purpose of the work was to assess the level of real water losses and the failure rate of the urban-rural water supply network in 2010-2016. The article's introduction contains the information on the types and causes of breakdowns in the water supply network. The life cycle of the leakage from its inception to its removal was also described. Next, the methodology and indicators for assessing actual losses in the water supply network were presented according to the guidelines of the International Water Association (IWA), i.e. ILI, CARL, UARL, RLB and water balance. The material and methods chapter describes how to calculate the failure rate. On the basis of the literature review, a method of assessing the failure of the water supply network and the level of actual water losses was presented. The research part presents the results of the water losses indicators values and assesses them against the literature data for the entire urban-rural system. The results of the failure of the water supply of the urban area and the rural area were also presented and compared with the literature data. A method of calculating limit values of the failure intensity index for the entire water supply system was also proposed. The changes in the intensity of failure occurrence during the year were presented. The object described in the studies achieved the A rating according to the classification of ILI and RLB values throughout the entire analysis period (2010-2016). Failure intensity in the analyzed period exceeded the average values calculated for water supply networks in Poland many times.

The rise in multidrug-resistant strains has prompted the search for novel strategies to produce tuberculostatic agents. This research is aimed at developing a derivative of ethambutol by gamma radiation-induced polymerization with polyethylene glycol (PEG). The synthesis was verified by Raman spectroscopy and UVVis spectrometry. The results show that PEG can be chemically bonded to ethambutol by amine and alcohol groups. In in vitro biological evaluation, PEGylated and neat ethambutol showed similar cell viabilities, while the modified drug lowered bacterial growth inhibitory activity. A mechanism for the polymerization is proposed. The particle size increased for PEGylated drugs concerning the starting polyether. Despite the low antimycobacterial activity in vitro, the product seems to be a promising tool for the rapid screening of hydrolase activity."

No clear correlation was found between the measured parameters inside and outside the building. The height above ground (the floor on which the measurements were made) was found to have a significant influence on the concentration of each pollutant.

The dry extracts were obtained from hydroethanolic (50 and 70%) extract using the ultrasound-assisted method. Folin-Ciocalteau reagent was used to determine the content of TPC. DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) in vitro assay was used to determine the ability to scavenge free radicals. The results analyses demonstrated that the ultrasound-assisted method produced a higher yield in both dry extracts (11%), in contrast to the conventional method. The 50% hydroethanolic solvent was more efficient in the extraction of bioactive compounds. Both extracts showed a positive correlation of phenolic content with antioxidant activity. The FTIR spectrograms showed changes in the chemical groups, as well as determining the aromaticity index of the extracts, indicating a higher aromatic prevalence to the solvent 50%, although it presented simpler phenolic structures. In conclusion, the results provide an important basis for the use of phenolic compounds extracted from guava leaves, not only due to the antioxidant activity exerted, however, for potential use as a crosslinking agent of sulfated and non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG)."

Beyond the substantial health impacts, the crisis has served as a catalyst for a dramatic shift in working practices, a greater reliance on technology, and a subsequent reduction in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions in the most heavily populated parts of the planet. Indeed, the crisis has highlighted the interconnected nature of society's vulnerabilities while also demonstrating that transformational change is possible. These rapid changes have ignited debate around how to build more resilient societies and the role of planning in promoting equitable and sustainable recovery. This article presents key insights from Ireland, as policymakers grapple with these questions and the role of technology in ensuring ongoing delivery of services and a continuation of democratic processes. Specifically, this short article focuses on the impact of the pandemic on town centres and regional growth in Ireland and the potential interventions which can aid in addressing recently intensified local challenges."

It has been used in Ayurveda for various diseases. So we decided to evaluate the toxicity effect of Kandhamal haladi, commonly use in the food industry, cosmetics, and pharmacology. The adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) model was used to evaluate the median lethal concentration (LC50). In the present study, acute toxic effects and behavioral alterations induced by exposure of the freshwater fish Danio rerio (zebrafish) to Kandhamal haladi was reported. Seven healthy specimens of the average size (3-4 cm in length and 1.0 +/- 0.78 g in weight) in each group were exposed to different concentrations of Kandhamal haladi for 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 96 h along with naive and control group in a static system. After 96 h exposure at a water temperature of 28.5 degrees C, their abnormal swimming behavioral patterns and abnormal ventilatory (respiratory) function, including hyperactivity, hypoactivity, and gulping, were observed. Alterations in behavioral patterns were well noticeable during the period of the experiment. The 96 h LC50 value of Kandhamal haladi to Danio rerio was found to be 173.516 mu M with lower and upper confidential limits (95%) as 152.146 mu M and 200.072 mu M respectively by using IBM SPSS statistics 25 software and 173.780 mu M using Microsoft Office Excel 2007 based on Finney's probit analysis statistical method. Mortality and behavioral changes were increased with increasing concentration of the compound within 24 to 96 hours. In addition to dose and dose-time dependent increase in the mortality rate, anxiety signs in the form of behavioral changes were observed in response to different test concentrations. Further researches are recommended to study the processes by which this chemical affects physiology and histology of fish and their accumulation in fish tissues. Our findings suggest that Kandhamal haladi can be used to fight against different fish diseases because of its low toxic effect on fishes, and supplementation of haladi could be recommended in aquaculture through a feed to prevent disease impact.

Those who claim their value and the essential role they play in human life and education are disqualified as conservatives, falsely accused of trying to anchor subjects to a past that is no longer valid, as if they were enemies of progress, development and innovation. This article analyzes a different way of understanding tradition as is presented by renowned contemporary authors like R. Scruton, A. MacIntyre and R. S. Peters. For them, assuming traditions allows us to establish fruitful intentional networks with those who preceded us, with our contemporaries and with the unborn. According to the theoretical nature of this work, philosophical methodology is used: location of relevant sources; reading, critical and comparative analysis of texts; hermeneutic interpretation and elaboration of conclusions and proposals. This study denotes that following a tradition is an intentional behavior that contains in itself the principle of its own evolution. There are no individual traditions: they are shared by a human group and conform the common background of expectations of society. Furthermore, traditions are plural and each culture is characterized by a central current that has passed the test of time and serves as a model and as a source of inspiration for those who live in the present. Traditions play an essential role in education, especially regarding its socializing function. Assuming the value of a traditions is not opposed to progress, but rather empowers it, by establishing intentional networks between past, present and future members of society."

Method: a sample of 8 older adults with obesity and controlled hypertension performed 6 weeks of strength training with intensities of 70% 1RM and 10RM, with a frequency of 4 times per week. Prior to the protocol of Training, triglycerides, cholesterol, blood glucose IGF-1, and anthropometric measures (size, weight, % fat and muscle mass) were determined. The test of one maximum repetition (1rm) was performed to evaluate maximum force in upper and lower limbs before and after the training program. Results: A significant increase (p<0.05) was observed in serum IGF-1 levels after the completion of training program. Conclusion: Strength training with intensities of 70% of 1RM and frequency of 4 days/week, carried out for 6 weeks, produced increases in serum IGF-1 concentration and increased muscle strength in older adults with obesity and controlled hypertension."

These models typically have parameters that are subject to intricate and stringent constraints, which make it more difficult to arrive at a proper estimation of these model parameters. Recently, vines and pair-copula constructions have been utilized in order to simplify construction of multivariate models for both continuous and discrete data. The pair-copula models break down the hierarchy of dependence into vines and employ bivariate or pair-copulas as building bricks to generate appropriate multivariate distributions. This paper discusses pair-copula methods to model the convoluted dependence structure and proposes using a C-Vine type copula to model the dependence among family members. Analysis of actual, real-world family data is presented to illustrate our models and estimation procedures."

This evaluation helps businesses obtain a quantitative measure of the benefits of a shift from monolith to microservices. Additionally, the metrics obtained could be used as a mechanism for continuous improvement of production application. This research proposes a model based on the principles of data mining called stream analytics feedback and optimization (SAFAO), which can be used to achieve a continuous optimization of microservices. Stream analytics is due to the fact that the analysis is performed on online application with continuously generated lived data. This approach has been tested in a simulated production environment based on Docker containers. The authors were able to establish empirical measures which were continuously extracted via a data mining methodology and then fed back into the running application through configuration management. The results show a continuous improvement in the performance of the microservices as indicated in the results presented in this research."

It is the great quest of constructing a square with the same area as a circle using a compass and straightedge in a finite number of steps. Since it was proven that. was a transcendental number in 1882, the task of Squaring the Circle has been considered impossible. Here, we will show it is possible to Square the Circle in space-time. It is not possible to Square the Circle in Euclidean space alone, but it is fully possible in space-time, and after all we live in a world with not only space, but also time. By drawing the circle from one reference frame and drawing the square from another reference frame, we can indeed Square the Circle. By taking into account space-time rather than just space, the impossible becomes possible! However, it is not enough simply to understand math in order to Square the Circle, one must understand some basic space-time physics as well. As a bonus, we have added a solution to the impossibility of Doubling the Cube. As a double bonus, we have also Boxed the Sphere! As we will see, one could claim that we have simply bent the rules and moved the problem from one place to another. One of the essential points of this paper, however, is that we can move challenging space problems out from space and into time, and vice versa."

Many natural compounds have been identified as beta-glucuronidase inhibitors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of hydro-methanolic extracts of 100 plants on beta-glucuronidase. The beta-glucuronidase activity was measured by a spectrophotometric method using Phenolphthalein glucuronide and 4-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucuronide. Kinetic study of the enzyme was performed in the presence and absence of the plant extract. It was revealed that from hydromethanolic (70%) extracts, Rosa damascena and Ipomoea tricolor showed more than 85% inhibitory effect on beta-glucuronidase. Rosa damascena showed competitive inhibition, and Ipomoea tricolor showed non-competitive inhibition. The K-m and V-max values for beta-glucuronidase were 23.32 mM and 0.814 mM min(-1), respectively. When using 4-nitrophenyl beta-D-glucuronide, Stevia and Cerasus avium showed more than 65% inhibitory effect on beta-glucuronidase. Both Stevia and Cerasus avium showed non-competitive inhibition. The K-m and V-max values for beta-glucuronidase were 16.98 mM and 0.936 mM min(-1), respectively. None of the plant extracts showed an activation effect on the enzyme.

The ability of drones capture high-quality photos from an aerial view and store and transmit such data presents a multi-facet problem. These actions possess privacy challenges to innocent users who can be spied on or drone owner's data which may be intercepted by a hacker. With all technological paradigms, utilities can be misused, and this is an increasing occurrence with drones. As a result, it is imperative to develop a novel methodological approach for the digital forensic analysis of a seized drone. This paper investigates six brands of drones commonly used in criminal activities and extracts forensically relevant data such as location information, captured images and videos, drones' flight paths, and data related to the ownership of the confiscated drone. The experimental results indicate that drone forensics would facilitate law enforcement in collecting significant information necessary for criminal investigations."

Since the 1980s, it has boosted the economic and political integration of its six member states, all of which are monarchies. After the Arab Spring of 2011, local crises triggered increasing tensions among its members due to their conflicting interests. The Council is the Saudi Arabia's primary area of influence. King Salman and Prince-Crown Mohammed bin Salman intend to reinforce the Saudi leadership over the rest of the partners to build a Riyadh-led common foreign policy. However, their goals are not fully shared by other Council countries, especially by Qatar, starting a period of severe internal rifts. This is completely destabilizing the local area and jeopardizing the organization's sustainability and integration mechanism.

The main water users-pollutants of the Southern Bug River Basin in Vinnytska and Mykolaivska regions were identified. The water quality of the surface water of the Southern Bug River in time and space (along the river stream) was analyzed. The water quality of the Southern Bug River was assessed by complex indices for different water users. In order to assess water quality, it is recommended to use complex indices that take into account the effect of the total action of pollutants. The self-purification potential and capability of restoration in space (along the river stream) of the aquatic ecosystem of the Southern Bug River was established for 2019. The results of the study allow us to state that the use of surface water of the Southern Bug River Basin for drinking, fishery, cultural and recreational needs is related to certain environmental risks.

The objective of this study was to describe the ecological knowledge and uses of the Amazonian manatee in the Extractive Reserve Verde para Sempre, Porto de Moz, Brazilian Amazon. This study was conducted through semi-structured interviews, free interviews, participant observation and image capture. Thirty-one residents were interviewed in 21 communities, using snowball sampling method. The interviewees were previously identified by local informants and selected according to their level of knowledge of the species. We collected information on the morphology, behavioral characteristics and feeding habits of manatees, and on the uses of the species by communities. Our findings suggest three hypotheses on the biology of Amazonian manatee: 1- the existence of three phenotypic patterns based on skin color and amount of fat; 2- changes in land use by agriculture, livestock and the installation of the hydroelectric plant affect their spatial distribution and seasonal migration; 3- they show reproductive behavior during the rainy season, in a polygamous way as a strategy of maintenance and genetic variability of the species. One third of the interviewees learned of the prohibition of manatee poaching during the implementation of the reserve. Poaching and consumption of manatees are rare, and entanglement of calves in fishing nets is accidental. These results reinforce the interest of local ecological knowledge in understanding the biology of the Amazonian manatee and their contribution to the delimitation of protected areas."

By considering the primal-dual dynamics as the interconnection of (i) a gradient system and (ii) a nonlinear controller with incremental sector-bounded static nonlinearity, we establish asymptotic stability by invoking the classical notions of Lyapunov stability, the invariance principle, along with some regularity assumptions. For the special case of strongly convex problem with affine constraints, we prove global exponential convergence. As compared to existing techniques in the literature, the proposed approach offers simple and transparent tuning guideline for robust exponential stability of the saddle-point dynamics and allows for establishing an upper bound on the exponential decay rate."

Practically, this reduction strategy requires small magnitude inputs so that the state remains close to the underlying attractor; when inputs become too large the reduction becomes unusable. Here, we develop an adaptive isostable coordinate framework that is valid for a continuous family of system parameters. Relations are derived that capture changes to the isostable coordinates in response to parameter changes. This information is subsequently used to define a reduction strategy valid for large magnitude but slowly varying inputs. The proposed reduction framework is compared to well-established linear and nonlinear proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) reduction techniques for simulations of the 1-dimensional nonlinear Burgers' equation with time-varying Dirichlet boundary conditions. In numerical simulations the proposed reduction strategy only requires a single mode to accurately capture system behavior. By contrast, the linear POD reduction performs poorly while the nonlinear POD strategy requires several modes to achieve comparable performance."

"WOS:000570975300081"	"Yes"	"bronze"	"In this work is reported the study of the interaction between ovalbumin protein (OVA) and N-Phthaloyl gamma-aminobutyric acid derivative (NPG). The ovalbumin is a kind of globular protein present in chicken eggs, as part of serpins globular family proteins present in many biological systems and natural environment; is commonly used in the food industry and the pharmaceutical field as an alternative material for microencapsulation of water-soluble drugs. However, this egg protein has discrete binding sites for ligands as occur in their homologs in mammalian. Association constants and thermodynamic parameters for the interaction of OVA with PNG were determined by linear and 2D fluorescence techniques, zeta-potential, acoustic densimetry, molecular modeling (docking), and molecular dynamics simulations in water as solvent at physiological pH. Fluorescence quenching of the internal fluorophore (tryptophan/tyrosine) in the range of temperature 296.15 K - 308.15 K resulted in values for the association constants of the order of 10 L mol, indicating an interaction between the NPG and the albumin. The negative values of Delta G degrees indicate a spontaneous process; Delta H degrees is positive indicates an endothermic process of association, and Delta S degrees is positive, and T Delta S degrees is the dominant term, which shows that the interaction is mainly due to hydrophobic factors, although, other experimental techniques suggest contributions from neutralization charge and hydrogen bonds there is also. The binding of NPG induced changes in OVA protein spatial conformation. The results of fluorescence and acoustic densimetry showed that the interaction promoted the unfolding of protein with a modest increase in the molar partial volume and loss of water molecules. The fluorescence quenching occurs through a static mechanism. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations studies support that NPG can interact with OVA accommodated in a superficial cavity involving hydrophobic forces and hydrogen bonds.

The results achieved during its assessment serve as a diagnostic and health indicator in clinical settings. Objective: this study aimed to investigate the physiological responses in males with and without SCI performing a maximal incremental test on an asynchronous arm crank ergometer (ACr) and on a recumbent synchronous handbike ergometer (HB). Methods: ten males with SCI and 11 able-bodied males (AB group) participated in this study. Two maximal graded exercise tests were performed, starting at 10 watts and increasing the workload by 10 watts every minute until exhaustion. Results: the AB group achieved lower workloads and absolute VO2 values than the SCI group during the HB test (all p < 0.05). The submaximal values of the relative VO2 peak and RER at workloads between 40-90 watts showed significant differences between SCI and AB on HB andACr. Significant linear relationships between workload and relative VO2 peak were found during the HB test (p < 0.001). Conclusions: these fmdings demonstrate that there are different physiological responses between adults with and without SCI when performing maximal and submaximal arm-ergometry. Interestingly, higher VO2 peak and workloads were achieved by the SCI group. In addition, specific prediction equations derived from the current study can be used to calculate the relative VO2 peak in handbikers with and without SCI."

Model development starts from basic two-dimensional integral equation for entropy production and describes film condensation on a vertical wall. Model covers entropy production, which is a result of two-dimensional heat transfer in a condensate layer, existence of velocity gradient and condensate layer viscosity. Entropy contribution of each of the members is explicitly derived in a closed form and the results of calculation are shown in the appropriate diagrams. Diagrams present film condensation of dry saturated water steam and dry saturated ammonia steam, both with saturation temperature of 100 degrees C with surface wall temperature of 98.5 degrees C. Obtained equations and presentation of the related results have shown that dominant entropy production is directly connected only with heat conduction in y-axis direction, where y-axis corresponds with thickness of condensate layer."

Material and Methods: 104 parents and their 3 to 13-year-old children (5.90 +/- 2.42) who received DRGA were surveyed before and after DRGA. The children were divided into two groups: Group 1 - healthy children (n=43) and Group 2 - children with medical problems (n=61). After recording their socio-demographic information, parents completed a self-administered questionnaire named Early Childhood Oral Health Impact Scale (ECOHIS), which includes two main parts - Child Impact Section (CIS) and Family Impact Section (FIS). On the other hand, the children received a dentist-administered questionnaire named Children's Fear Survey Schedule-Dental Subscale (CFSS-DS) and Frankle Behavior Scale (FBS). For statistical analyses, Wilcoxon Signed-Rank, Mann Whitney-U, Kruskal-Wallis, and Spearman's Correlation tests were used. Results: A statistically significant decrease in all CIS, FIS, ECOHIS and CFSS-DS scores was observed after DRGA (p<0.01).

Effect of four process parameters, namely layer thickness (LT), build orientation (BO), build position (BP) on platform, and delay time (DT) on CS of calcium sulfate-based bone scaffolds, have been studied experimentally. L9 orthogonal array (OA) is chosen to design and perform the experiments. LT: 89 pm, BO: 0o, BP: Middle, and DT: 200 ms are the optimum values of parameters obtained by S/N ratio analysis. LT is most significant (48.18%), BO is slightly less significant than LT (45%), BP is little significant (6.39%), and DT is found non-significant (0.43%) as per the ANOVA analysis. A linear regression model is developed to predict the CS of fabricated scaffolds. The developed model is found adequate with 94.4% and 93%, R-sq and R-sq(adj) values, respectively.

Material and Methods: Purposive sampling was used to recruit patients from the Oral Medicine Unit of Kerman University Dental School. An experienced independent facilitator convened the focus groups and conducted individual interviews in a non-clinical setting. Focus groups were mixed regarding their gender, age, chronic oral mucosal condition, time since diagnosis, and severity. A total of 39 patients participated in the study, including patients with oral lichen planus, pemphigus, recurrent aphthous stomatitis and leukoplakia. Results: Analysis of the interviews revealed that patient views could be divided into the following themes: biopsychosocial issues, treatment limitations and side effects, unpredictability of the conditions and the potential for malignant transformation. Chronic oral mucosal conditions affected patients' daily lives in various areas, from physical health and functioning to concerns about their future. Conclusion: The oral medicine practitioner's role in treating patients with chronic oral mucosal diseases extended beyond active management and symptomatic relief to the management of all aspects of these conditions that affected their daily lives."

Three hundred fifty-four respondents from China were used to examine the research hypotheses in PLS method. The results verify that PU plays an important role in the mobile fitness. In addition, PU fully influences CUFA through attitude loyalty and satisfaction-attitude loyalty, respectively. However, satisfaction does not mediate PU on CUFA. The results suggest that only satisfying fitness Apps is not enough for maintaining the mobile fitness and users' attitude loyalty is more important. Moreover, fitness mobility negatively moderates the relationship between attitude loyalty and CUFA, revealing the boundary condition in the CUFA behavior."

The creation of self-replicating transgenic animals bioreactors that secrete biologically active proteins in milk is a promising direction of modern biotechnology. The rabbit is the smallest animal used both in laboratory practice and in animal breeding, from which recombinant pharmaceutical proteins can be obtained on an experimental and industrial scale. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, many rabbits have been created in the world - biomodels of human diseases (with gene knockout, transgenic) and producers of human proteins. Rabbits can be effectively used as bioreactors. Whey acidic protein (WAP) is the main protein of whey, its content in rabbit milk is about 15 g /l, which makes the WAP gene promising for replacing the gene of biologically active protein using the CRISPR/Cas9 system."

The tracking Bellman equation and the game algebraic Riccati equation (GARE) are derived. The solution to the GARE leads to the feedback and feedforward parts of the control input. A Q-learning algorithm is then developed to learn the solution of the GARE online without requiring any knowledge of the system dynamics. Convergence of the algorithm is analyzed, and it is also proved that probing noises in maintaining the persistence of excitation (PE) condition do not result in any bias.

"WOS:000550629000016"	""	""	"In the robotics literature, experience transfer has been proposed in different learning-based control frameworks to minimize the costs and risks associated with training robots. While various works have shown the feasibility of transferring prior experience from a source robot to improve or accelerate the learning of a target robot, there are usually no guarantees that experience transfer improves the performance of the target robot. In practice, the efficacy of transferring experience is often not known until it is tested on physical robots. This trial-and-error approach can be extremely unsafe and inefficient. Building on our previous work, in this letter we consider an inverse module transfer learning framework, where the inverse module of a source robot system is transferred to a target robot system to improve its tracking performance on arbitrary trajectories. We derive a theoretical bound on the tracking error when a source inverse module is transferred to the target robot and propose a Bayesian-optimization-based algorithm to estimate this bound from data. We further highlight the asymmetric nature of cross-robot experience transfer that has often been neglected in the literature. We demonstrate our approach in quadrotor experiments and show that we can guarantee positive transfer on the target robot for tracking random periodic trajectories."

For this, in the first part, the concept of mindfulness is analyzed from its essential nature according to the Buddhist perspective, which integrates its moral foundations and its political implications. Likewise, the use of mindfulness in the educational field is criticized as a mere technique, in order to, from there, defend the possibilities of its inclusion as an onto-epistemological essence of pedagogical action. In the second part, the principles of this proposal of physical education focused on the expansion of the unconditional consciousness of the human being are developed: a physical education oriented to personal and moral growth, which stimulates political participation and contributes to social transformation."

In this study, 29 water samples were collected from the mine and 5 were collected from a control area. A broad energy germanium detector was used to measure the activity concentrations of Uranium-238, Thorium-232, and Potassium-40. Their activity concentrations were then used to calculate radiological hazard parameters in water for the area. The average value of the Radium Equivalent Activity (Ra-eq) in water samples from the mining area and from the control area was found to he lower than the allowable limit of 370 Bq.L-1. The Annual Effective Dose Equivalent (AEDE) was found to be equal to 1.29x10(-3) mSv.y(-1), a value below worldwide average of 2.4 mSv.y(-1) for natural radiation. The external hazard (H-ex) and internal hazard (H-in) index for water samples from the mining area were less than unity, making water samples safe to the population in the area."

Thirteen university students attended the Laboratory of Biosciences of Human Motricity on three random occasions: follicular (F-Folicular), ovulatory (E-Ovulatoria) and lutcal (F-Lutea)phase (between days 7 - 9,12 -14 and 23 - 25 of their regular menstrual cycle, respectively). All of them were eumenorrheic, physically active, apparently healthy, and had no history of ingesting honnones (age = 20.8 +/- 1.0 years; height = 157.8 +/- 6.0 cm; weight = 59.4 +/- 6.8 kg; body fat = 27.5 +/- 5.8%). At each visit, they performed a vertical jump test and an aerobic resistance test. Using Friedman test of repeated measures, no differences were found in vertical jump (F-Folicular = 38.1 +/- 14.4 cm, E-Ovulatoria = 36.0 +/- 14.2 cm, F-Lutea = 36.7 +/- 14.4 cm; p = 0.075) nor in aerobic resistance (F-Folicular = 783.6 +/- 126.9 meters, E-Ovulatoria = 812.9 +/- 179.1 meters, F-Lutea = 784.5 +/- 128.8 meters; p = 0.775) between the different phases of the menstrual cycle.

We analyzed the complexity of the knowledge of teacher practice and how the everyday forges such knowledge. In this sense, the reflections that we bring in this writing meet the perspective that sees teaching as a localized professional practice, with the teacher as an active subject who resignifies and intervenes in the actions of their profession. Through testimony of History teachers from public high schools in the city of Maranguape, in the state of Ceara, it was possible to verify that the daily making of the teaching profession constitutes an undeniable locus of training for the definition of the professional identity of the teacher, revealing the gaps left by the initial training, thus revealing the formative character of the practice of the act of teaching."

In the proposed algorithm, each node employs an error-nonlinearity into the update equation to mitigate the detrimental effects of impulsive noise. Moreover, the algorithm estimates both the optimal error non-linearity and the unknown parameter together, which in turn, obviates the requirement of prior knowledge about the statistical characteristics of measurement noise. In addition to algorithm development, its steady-state performance as well as convergence analysis have been provided. Simulation results validate the correctness of the analysis and reveal the superiority of the proposed algorithm over some existing algorithms."

To surmount this issue, we develop an efficient hybrid method with O(N) computational cost and O(M) memory complexity in solving two-dimensional time fractional diffusion equation. The presented method is based on the Laplace transform method and a finite difference scheme. The stability and convergence of the proposed method are analyzed rigorously by the means of the Fourier method. A comparative study drawn from numerical experiments shows that the hybrid method is accurate and reduces the computational cost, memory requirement as well as the CPU time effectively compared to a standard finite difference scheme."

In CBIR the image is used as a query to find the most similar images. One of the biggest challenges in CBIR system is to fill up the semantic gap, which is the gap between low-level visual features and the high-level semantic concepts of an image. In this paper, the authors have proposed a saliency-based CBIR system that utilizes the semantic information of image and users search intention. In the proposed model, firstly a significant region is identified with the help of method structured matrix decomposition (SMD) using high-level priors that highlight the prominent area of the image. After that, a two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA) is used as a feature, which is compact and effectively used for fast recognition. Experiment results are validated on different image dataset having an extensive collection of semantic classifications."
