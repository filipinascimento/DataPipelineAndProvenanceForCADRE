"WOS:000542869600011"	""	""	"This letter discusses a new approach to overcome unmeasurable premise variables in observer synthesis for Takagi-Sugeno models. The main idea is based on the decoupling of the nonlinear dynamics in order to manage unmeasured state existing into the membership functions. The obtained structure is a system with membership functions subjected only to measured variables. The stability analysis of the observer is carried out using Lyapunov theory. The observer gains were computed from the resolution of the Linear Matrix Inequality constraints. The present result alleviates the strong conditions assumed in the design of observers for TS systems with unmeasurable premise variables. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

This has led to the constant demand for safety evaluation of herbal mixtures by regulatory bodies. Here, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster was used for the safety evaluation of Ruzu Herbal Bitters, a polyherbal mixture. Firstly, 14 days of survival followed by longevity studies were carried out on flies treated with Ruzu (0, 20, 40, and 60 mu L/g diet). Then a similar treatment was carried out for 5 days to assess selected biochemical markers. The results showed no significant effect was noticed on the survival rate of the fruit fly. Long-term exposure showed that Ruzu (40 mu L/g diet) increased the lifespan of flies by 6%, while 60 mu L/g diet reduced their lifespan by 13%. Ruzu Herbal bitters did not alter the negative geotaxis, acetylcholinesterase, and glutathione-S-transferase activities in flies. Nitric oxide level was unaffected, except at an extreme concentration of 60 mu L/g diet. Moreover, Ruzu (20 mu L/g diet) significantly increased the total thiol level. The glucose level was also significantly reduced. Our data thus suggest that short term consumption of moderate doses of Ruzu Herbal Bitters might be safe for oral consumption. The hypoglycaemic property observed here may imply that it might be used as an antidiabetic drug."

In most of them, jumps are usually the most difficult elements and need to be high enough so to complete several rotations. The aim of the present study was to analyse the kinetic variables and the vertical stiffness of eight andalusian female figure skaters aged 14-18 years old, comparing them to a group of eight sedentary female subjects of the same age. Flight height and the following kinetic variables during a countermovement jump (CMJ) were analyzed: maximal displacement of the centre of mass, peak force, average force, acceleration impulse, length of the acceleration impulse, average power, peak power, vertical stiffness, vertical stiffness normalized to body mass and maximum downward velocity during the eccentric phase. Results showed that figure skaters had flight heights greater than sedentary subjects and they also exhibited greater values of power and acceleration impulse, which means that they have higher explosive strength. However, average force developed during the concentric phase was not significantly higher in figure skaters. Further research comparing figure skaters with other athletes is needed, with special focus on the analysis of vertical stiffness and maximum downward velocity, so to clarify whether figure skaters make a good use of the stretch-shortening cycle; also to understand how to develop higher average force during the concentric phase of jumps."

The objective has been to determine the variation in the temporal space of black carbon, the amount of light-absorbing particles and the decrease of albedo on the surface of the Ampay glacier. 10 snow samples were selected at various locations on the glacier during 2017. The light absorption heating method has been applied to measure light-absorbing particles, a technique that measures the temperature increase of the particle charge in a filter applying visible light that estimates the amount of light energy. The results show in terms of effective black carbon, the highest of 65,224 nanograms of black carbon per gram of water in the month of October and the minimum value of 20,941 nanograms of black carbon per gram of water in the month of February, typically associated with the rain. The energy absorbed by the light-absorbing particles in the Ampay glacier, the highest corresponds to the month of November with 8,952.92 J s/m(2) and lowest in February with 2,747.26 J s/m(2). In April, the amount of snow melted due to light-absorbing particles has been approximately 13.57 kg/m(2). Melting has increased considerably in other months with the largest melting, with a value of 26.65 kg/m(2), almost 7.0 kW/m(2) of snow turned into water in the month of November. It is concluded that the technique of the Light absorption heating method is adequate because it is optimal for the achievement of the research objectives, it is economical, effective and has allowed quantifying light-absorbing particles in snow."

The environmental impact of climate change, especially in densely populated developing countries such as Nigeria cannot be overlooked without seeking to provide useful information to help avert the consequences arising from it. Therefore, the aim of this research is to simulate the effect of climate change on the stream-flow of Ala River, Akure, Nigeria and this aim is achieved by projecting future rainfall due to climate change and simulating a hydrologic model of the river. Precipitation change experienced in the world climate system was considered and projection of precipitation for Ala, Akure was done by statistically downscaling General Circulation Model (GCM) under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.0) climate scenario. The projected climate change alongside other hydrologic parameters was input into Hydrologic Engineering Centre-Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) version 4.2 to simulate a hydrologic model so as to achieve the peak discharges at a different cross-section of the river reach. The peak discharges obtained for the Ala River basin indicate a continuous increase of the runoff generated as a result of an increase in precipitation as the years progresses resulting from a change in the climate system."

The proposed method simultaneously estimates states and posteriors of matrix functions given data. In particular, states are estimated by reaching a consensus between an estimator based on past system trajectory and an estimator by recurrent equations of states; posteriors are approximated by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the parameterized posterior distribution and the true posterior of the LPV model parameters. Furthermore, techniques such as transfer learning are explored in this letter to reduce computational cost and prevent convergence failure of Bayesian inference. The proposed data-driven method is validated using experimental data for identification of a control-oriented reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) engine model."

This letter proposes a new type of TFPGs, called Real-Valued Timed Failure Propagation Graphs (rTFPGs), designed for continuous-state systems. More importantly, it presents a systematic way of constructing rTFPGs by combining the powers of human experts and data-driven methods: first, an expert constructs a partial rTFPG based on his/her expertise; then a data-driven algorithm refines the rTFPG by adding nodes and edges based on a given set of labeled signals.

However, due to the abundance of sandstone reservoirs in the world and the necessity to increase recovery in these types of reservoirs, injection of smart water will disturb the distribution of intergranular stresses in the porous media which results in sand production that causes many problems in many parts of the petroleum industry. For this reason, the necessity to investigate possible parameters affecting sand production was increased. Also, according to the relative researches, the injection of smart water changes the reservoir pH, which could change the sand production rate. In this paper, a comprehensive study on the effect of pH or alkalinity on sand production, as well as the effect and mechanism of silica nanoparticles, has been performed to control the grains separated from the rock.

It involves various activities, such as configuration management, security management, and data management. Monitoring these activities is essential to improve performance and QoS of fog computing infrastructure. Data collection and aggregation are the basic tasks in the monitoring process, and these phases consume more communicational power as the IoT nodes generate a huge amount of redundant data frequently. In this paper, a multi-agent-based data collection and aggregation model is proposed for monitoring fog infrastructure. The data collection model adopts a hybrid push-pull algorithm that updates the data when a certain change in new data compared to old data. A tree-based data aggregation model is developed to reduce communication overhead between fog node and cloud. The experimental results show that the proposed model improves data coherency and reduces communication overhead compared to existing data collection and aggregation models."

Methodology: In methodological terms, this is a qualitative research, which collected the data through the application of a questionnaire with in-depth interviews, using the NVivo 12 Pro software. Main results: The results indicate that in undergraduate courses that do not they are related to Applied Social Sciences, they still do not discuss entrepreneurship in the institution; that the proposing unit for SET, should not be just an Academic Unit, but a group of people who identify with the subject; and that the managers willingness to participate and support the dialogue on issues related to sustainability (economic, social and environmental) corroborates with the statement that SET can be one of the paths to be followed to establish sustainability in its Units. Practical and theoretical implications: From the results found, it is possible to observe as a contribution of the study, the identification of the possibilities and limits for the construction of a Sustainable Entrepreneurial Training. Possibilities: Acceptance of a broader entrepreneurship aimed at balancing the three dimensions of sustainability in Units resistant to entrepreneurship; Restructure and include the theme in existing disciplines, among others. Limits: Ignorance of the managers of the Academic Units about sustainable entrepreneurship; Lack of managers perception of how to conduct an SET in their unit, among others."

There is a need for proper and up-to-date soil maps produced with support of technology to achieve sustainable management of land and soil successfully. In order to facilitate the collection of soil data on site in a correct, fast and reliable way in soil survey and mapping studies, and therefore to produce soil maps with high accuracy, a mobile GIS application called Soil Data System was developed in this study to work in mobile devices which are driven by Android 5.0 and above. The developed application was tested in Abadan Erosion Control Project implementation area, which is located in the boundaries of Ankara, Turkey and was completed in 2016 within the General Directorate of Forestry of The Republic of Turkey, and various findings were obtained after comparing the application with classical soil survey and mapping studies. As a result of the analyzes, it was observed that Soil Data System contributed positively to soil mapping process in many aspects such as accuracy, transparency and time."

First, for open-loop stable MASs, a distributed predictive observer is proposed to estimate the consensus tracking error and to construct the control input that does not involve any integral term (which is time-efficient in calculation). Then, using the generalized Nyquist criterion, we derive the conditions for asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop system and show that is delay-independent. Subsequently, another observer is designed that allows the MASs to be open-loop unstable. Next, we use the generalized Nyquist criterion to compute the observer's gain matrix. Towards this end, we choose a specific structure with which the problem boils down to computing a single parameter, herein called the predictive observer parameter. Two algorithms are proposed for choosing this parameter: one for general linear systems and one for monotone systems. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work for which asymptotic convergence of consensus is proven for general linear MASs with arbitrary heterogeneous delays. Finally, the validity of our results is demonstrated via a vehicle platooning example."	"The work of Themistoklis Charalambous was supported by the Academy of Finland under Grant 317726.

Protein engineering is one of the major biotechnology tools in the field of modification and advancement of biocatalysts capabilities. Among the most effective protein engineering methods, in particular, to improve the industrial strain capabilities, is the shuffling genome method. This study aimed to follow knowledge and biocatalysts engineering techniques based on DNA shuffling methods. In the first step, two procedures were followed (DES method and compatibility according to the concentration gradient of Diazinon) to obtain mutant strains. Acquired mutant strains from both methods were resistant to high concentrations of poison up to 3000 mg/L. The activity of these strains also demonstrated their elevated activity compared to parent samples. The highest activity was related to four strains IR1.G1, IR1.D8, IR1.D4, and IR1.D5, which were 0.234 U/ml, 0.1 U/ml, 0.098 U/ml, and 0.066 U/ml, respectively. The improved strain was obtained via the concentration gradient of the diazinon method (IRL1.G1 strain) in comparison with IRL1.D8 strain (owning highest activity through DES method) possesses excessive activity in 3000 mg/L concentration of Diazinon. The evaluated results of first-generation genome shuffling of strains (the first round of protoplast fusion) also indicated that those shuffled strains with the ability to grow in the vicinity of the toxin (3000 mg/L concentration of Diazinon) showed better activity than obtained mutated strains by both methods (concentration gradient of the toxin and the DES method). In the final stage, the best results were related to IRL1.F2, IRL1.F3, and IRL1.F1 shuffled strains with 0.541 mg/L, 0.523 mg/L, and 0.509 mg/L, respectively. The highest activity belonged to the IRL1.F2 genome shuffled strain (first round of protoplast fusion). This strain could grow in a high concentration of toxin, and also, the activity was increased 30, 3.6, and 2.3 times in comparison with the parent strain (IRL1), IRL.D8 mutant, and IRL1.G1, respectively."

It has been developing as a great source of renewable energy. This device makes use of simple cathode and anode compartments and a separating membrane. This can be efficiently used for power generations and wastewater treatments. Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC), a type of MFC is also used in generating Hydrogen energy from various biological matters. The performance of MFC totally depends upon the nature of microorganisms, electrodes selected, and the separating membarane used.

This characterization relies on recent concentration of measure results and is given in terms of ambiguity sets. Second, we extend the results to environments whose mean behavior is also unknown but described by a parameterized class of possible mean behaviors. Our algorithm adapts the ambiguity set dynamically by learning the parametric dependence online, and retaining similar probabilistic guarantees with respect to the additive, unknown disturbance.

As a result, some already known properties of the square root which is computed with this method are deduced. If any other number base is used, the justification given shows that the method is applied in the same way and that the deduced properties are still being fulfilled, facts that highlight the importance of positional number systems. It also shows how to generalize the method to compute high orders roots. Although with this elementary method you can compute the square root of any real number, with the exact number of decimal places that you want, the mathematicians of ancient China were not able to generalize it for the purpose of computing irrational roots, because they did not know a positional number system. Finally, in order for high school students gain a better understanding of number systems, the examples given in this paper show how they can use the square root calculus with this method to practice elementary operations with positional number systems with different bases, and also to explore some relationships between them."

In the development of these models, the variables included in the model are as important as the method applied. For this reason, the gray relational analysis method has been considered in determining the indicators that affect the financial situation of the companies. As a result of the analysis, it was determined that the LR model, which is one of the prediction models, has a higher rate of prediction power than the data envelopment analysis in predicting the financial failure of the companies. However, DEA is also an easy and fast method for predicting financial failures, and is recommended to companies on the indicators that they need to improve in order to be successful.

It is known that if the differential flows associated with the subsystems of a switched DAE commute, then the switched DAE with regular and stable DAE subsystems is asymptotically stable. Our first Lie algebraic result substitutes the condition of commutativity of the differential flows with the more general condition of solvability of the Lie algebra generated by them, and thus, clearly, generalizes the existing commutativity based result. There is, however, one caveat: the Lie algebraic criterion provides stability under switching signals that have a non-zero infimum dwell-time. This is in stark contrast with the case of conventional switched linear systems where the Lie algebraic condition works for all switching signals. We further explore this unique phenomenon of switched DAEs in this letter: we show that a switched DAE satisfying the Lie algebraic criterion is not necessarily stable for all arbitrary switching sequences. Finally, we derive a Lie algebraic stability criterion in terms of the original system matrices, as opposed to the earlier result involving differential flows."

To solve this issue, the extended locational marginal price (eLMP in short, a.k.a. convex hull price) has been proposed. The key idea is to convexify the non-convex generation cost functions due to the startup costs, and then design the uplift payment whenever necessary. While eLMP partially solves the incentive issue, there are still chances for generators to manipulate the market prices (as well as the uplift payments) by strategic bidding. In this letter, we first propose a profit decomposition method to evaluate different bidding strategies' impacts on individual payoffs. This decomposition allows us to better identify the potential strategic generators and investigate their best strategies. We further propose to use the maximal markup as an index for eLMP scheme to quantify market power in the whole system. Numerical studies further highlight the existence of market power in practice."

Since the cost functions and resources are time varying, the optimal solutions are trajectories changing over time rather than some constants. By combining the prediction-correction method with the finite-time nonsmooth consensus idea, we propose a distributed continuous-time algorithm that ensures that the states of all agents will track the corresponding time-varying optimal trajectories with vanishing error when the cost functions have identical Hessians. Here each agent exchanges only local information through a fixed connected undirected graph in a distributed manner. We perform a simulation for the grid-connected battery energy storage system to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed continuous-time optimal resource allocation algorithm."

"WOS:000597141300015"	""	""	"Signal Temporal Logic (STL) has gained popularity in recent years as a specification language for cyber-physical systems, especially in robotics. Beyond being expressive and easy to understand, STL is appealing because the synthesis problem-generating a trajectory that satisfies a given specification-can be formulated as a trajectory optimization problem. Unfortunately, the associated cost function is nonsmooth and non-convex. As a result, existing synthesis methods scale poorly to high-dimensional nonlinear systems. In this letter, we present a new trajectory optimization approach for STL synthesis based on Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). It is well known that DDP scales well to extremely high-dimensional nonlinear systems like robotic quadrupeds and humanoids: we show that these advantages can be harnessed for STL synthesis.

The major bioactive compound found in turmeric is curcumin, and tamarind is procyanidin. Both compounds could reduce prostaglandin concentration, leading to the reduction of primary dysmenorrhea by inhibiting COXs. This study aims to identify the interaction of tamarind and turmeric bioactive compounds as single isolated compound and complex compounds to COXs using in silico as a model study. Proteins and bioactive compounds were obtained from PDB database and Pubchem, respectively. Both proteins and ligands will be prepared using Discovery Studio Client 3.5 and PyRx 0.8. The interaction will be performed by docking using Autodock Vina in PyRx 0.8. It showed that turmeric and tamarind bioactive compounds in single isolated form have potency in inhibiting COX-1/COX-2, and both ligands bind to the catalytic site of proteins. Binding sites are surrounding the binding site of the natural substrate with an efficient binding affinity. In the complex form of turmeric-tamarind, the binding affinity is not as efficient as single compounds. However, its complex form of both compounds provides strong inhibition.

OHCP is an electron-rich ligand that is capable of reducing as well as encapsulate the metal ions because of the availability of electron-rich hydrazide functional group and H-bonding promoter four pyrrole units. In comparison with normal hydrazine, CP-hydrazide has a higher withdrawal ability, so Pd-NPs periphery is surrounded by them and undergoes stronger web-like capping on palladium. Similarly, OHCP-PdNPs are aqueous and air-stable, besides affordable alternatives for the synthesis of stable PdNPs. Moreover, encapsulating the periphery of PdNPs using OHCP enhances its activity and selectivity. Which indicates the perfect association of metal-cage recognition?

For this purpose, we apply three different statistical techniques, namely copula, coverage and copula-coverage. More precisely, this study presents a stochastic model for analysing the behaviour of a multi-state system consisting of two non-identical units by incorporating the concept of coverage factor and two types of repair facilities between failed state to a normal state. The system could be characterized as being in a failed state due to unit failures, human failure and major failures, such as catastrophic and environmental failure. All failure rates are constant and it is assumed that these are exponentially distributed whereas, repair rates follow the Gumbel-Hougaard copula distribution. The entire system is modelled as a finite-state Markov process. Time-dependent reliability measures like availability, reliability and mean time to failure (MTTF) are obtained by supplementary variable techniques and Laplace transformations. The present study provides a comparative analysis for reliability measures among the aforementioned techniques, while a discussion referring to which technique makes the system more reliable is also developed. Furthermore, numerical simulations are presented to validate the analytical results."

More precisely, it maps the set of vectors with zero sign variations to itself. A linear dynamical system is called k-positive if its flow maps the set of vectors with up to k-1 sign variations to itself. A nonlinear dynamical system is called k-cooperative if its variational system, which is a time-varying linear dynamical system, is k-positive. These systems have special asymptotic properties. For example, it was recently shown that strong 2-cooperative systems satisfy a strong Poincare-Bendixson property. Positivity and k-positivity are easy to verify in terms of the sign-pattern of the matrix in the dynamics. However, these sign conditions are not invariant under a coordinate transformation. A natural question is to determine if a given n-dimensional system is k-positive up to a coordinate transformation. We study this problem for two special kinds of transformations: permutations and scaling by a signature matrix. For any n <= 4 and k is an element of{2, ... , n-2} , we provide a graph-theoretic necessary and sufficient condition for k-positivity up to such coordinate transformations.

This allows non-parametric modeling of arbitrary distributions underlying on the SE(3) group. The proposal distribution for importance sampling is estimated particle-wise by a novel dual quaternion unscented Kalman filter (DQ-UKF). It is adapted to the manifold geometric structure and drives the prior particles towards high-likelihood regions on the manifold. The resultant unscented dual quaternion particle filter (U-DQPF) incorporates the most recently observed evidence, raising the particle efficiency considerably for nonlinear pose estimation tasks.

This document presents a strategy to reduce diesel consumption in an out-of-grid system formed by renewable sources (PV-HKT-WT-DG). Three energy dispatch strategies have been proposed to verify the impact on diesel consumption and generator operating hours. In addition, different energy storage technologies (acid lead, lithium-ion, vanadium redox flow, pump storage and supercapacitor) have been considered. The HOMER software has been used to calculate the optimal size of the systems through technical-economic indicators. The results show that it is possible to reduce diesel consumption progressively; however, the cost of energy increases. On the other hand, when using lithium-ion batteries under charge cycle control, the penetration of the diesel generator has been greatly reduced without affecting the cost of the system. Finally, sensitivity analyzes have shown that when demand increases, diesel consumption does not increase significantly by using redox vanadium flow batteries, whereas the diesel generator operating hours decrease significantly in all systems."

The aim of these machine learning approaches is to build automated diagnostic tool for helping the physician as well as monitor the health status of patients. These diagnostic tools are widely adopted in intensive care unit for life expectancy of patients. In this study, an effort is made to design an automated diagnostic model for the diagnosis and prediction of diabetes patients. The proposed diagnostic model is designed using artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm and deep neural network (DNN) technique, called ABC-DNN-based diagnostic model. The ABC algorithm is applied to determine the relevant features for diabetes prediction and diagnosis while DNN technique is adopted for the prediction and diagnosis of diabetes affected patients. The performance of proposed diagnostic model is tested over Pima Indian Diabetes dataset and evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, Kappa, and area under curve (AUC) parameters. Further, 10-fold and 50-50% training-testing method are considered to assess the performance of proposed diagnostic model. The experimental results of proposed ABC-DNN model is compared with DNN technique and several existing diabetes studies. It is observed that proposed ABC-DNN model achieves 94.74% accuracy rate using 10-fold method."

The recording of brain activity was performed through a brain-interface device Emotiv Epoc (R) while the students remain seated, relaxed and with their eyes closed for two minutes. The logs were performed before and after 30-minutes of aerobic exercise. The results show that the number of correlations between the Hurst exponents show similar modifications between the experimental group and control group in the delta, beta and gamma waves. In theta waves there are a greater number of modifications in the experimental group (100% v/s 83.3%), a more pronounced situation in alpha (83.3% v/s 16.7%). In conclusion, the intervention with 30-minutes of aerobic physical exercise shows effects on the number of correlations for theta and alpha waves between the Hurst exponents at rest.

Bike sharing system (BSS) facilitates people's travel, relieves traffic jams, and mitigates carbon emissions. In this research, a basic method is proposed to measure the carbon emission mitigation of dock-less BSS from the perspective of life cycle analysis (LCA). The method is applied in a typical city of China (i.e., the city of Beijing). The carbon emissions of six models of shared bikes in Beijing are calculated in this paper. The results indicate that: (a) the use process of dock-less BSS has mitigated carbon emissions in the central district of Beijing (9.23 Mt CO2-eq in 2016 and 9.26 Mt CO2-eq in 2017); (b) in consideration of all life cycle processes of BSS, the carbon emissions actually has risen with the best scenario of 10% substitute rate (i.e., 33.2 Mt CO(2-eq )in 2016 and 80.9 Mt CO2-eq in 2017); (c) the carbon mitigation effect of BSS is closely related to the processes of production, maintenance and rebalancing.

The model allows shortages which are completely backlogged in order to achieve better preserving amenity. The authors present some optimal solutions which leads to determine the total inventory cost in which the collective behavior of customers hinges on the waiting time. An easy-to-use optimization technique is included to find the shortage time point and order quantity to minimize the total system cost. Taking into account the above-mentioned assumptions, different kinds of numerical examples are considered to illustrate the theoretical behavior of the framed optimization model. The sensitivity analysis is made for this problem with variation of parameters. The study shows that the optimal solution not only exists but also is unique and is less expensive to operate if the factors of three-phase variation, representing the growth, the steady, and the decline phases of demand with respect to time are considered."

This article contributes to this debate by analyzing the spatial distribution of primary schools in the municipality of Vagos. It is based on a linear programming approach to optimize the resources needed for the operation and installation of school facilities and the level of accessibility that is provided. The simulated configurations are used as benchmarks for the actual spatial distribution of schools, identifying how it could be made more efficient or equitable and the criteria which have been prioritized in recent school planning policies. This allowed to conclude that, in the analyzed context, changes to the spatial distribution of schools have been made with significant equity concerns and that, while it would be possible to decrease costs through further consolidation, this would pose significant equity challenges."

These systems can operate only for a finite interval of time before the system variables deviate from the normal operating region. Thus, in order to characterize the performance of the systems, it is important to analyze the duration of the normal operation, which is closely related to the notion of finite-time stability. In this letter, we propose an algebraic optimization approach to analyze finite-time stability of resource limited chemical reactions. Specifically, we present semidefinite programs that compute guaranteed lower and upper bounds of the duration of the normal operation, which we call survival time, for a given set of uncertain initial concentrations. The proposed semidefinite programs provide progressively tighter bounds of survival time by increasing the variables and constraints, allowing for the tuning of the balance between the computational time and the conservativeness of the bounds. We demonstrate the proposed method using the regenerator circuit of DNA strand displacement reactions."

The true parameter is unknown to the learning agent. However, the set of possible parameters, which is finite, is known a priori. We propose an algorithm that is simple and easy to implement, which we call Finitely Parameterized Upper Confidence Bound (FP-UCB) algorithm, which uses the information about the underlying parameter set for faster learning. In particular, we show that the FP-UCB algorithm achieves a bounded regret under some structural condition on the underlying parameter set. We also show that, if the underlying parameter set does not satisfy the necessary structural condition, the FP-UCB algorithm achieves a logarithmic regret, but with a smaller preceding constant compared to the standard UCB algorithm. We also validate the superior performance of the FP-UCB algorithm through extensive numerical simulations."

Therefore to target and to modulate PPIs is an efficient approach for the disease treatment. Cancer is also arising because of Protein-protein interaction. In cancer, the tumor suppressor p53 protein got inhibited by the MDM2 protein. p53 protein regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis. Interaction between the p53-MDM2 proteins is responsible for the inhibition of the p53 function. By this interaction, MDM2 degrades and inhibits the p53 protein. Hence, to target and inhibit the p53-MDM2 interaction for the treatment of cancer is the rational approach. By targeting this interaction with the drugs, we can selectively kill the cancer cells over the normal cells. Recently, p53-MDM2 interaction inhibitor drugs have been reported by many researchers and pharmaceutical companies. And several drugs entered into the clinical trials. In this study, a novel 1,2,4-triazole based molecules were designed as MDM2 inhibitors and performed their in-silico study. We designed the novel compound 01 and Lead 1a. In this work, In silico study of the Lead 1a and reference compounds (Nutlin 3a, RG7112) was carried out. The molecular docking study of the Novel 1,2,4-triazole based lead 1a and reference compounds was carried out. The docking score of the Lead 1a found to be better than Nutlin 3a and close to RG7112. The various possible conformations and binding affinity values were also determined by the docking study. These results indicate the Lead 1a as a potential MDM2 inhibitor and anti-cancer agent."

In this study We analyzed the influence that a challenge methodology has on the achievement of these recommendations. To this end, 80 students (13 men and 67 women) from the university degrees in Teaching in Primary School Education (52) and Nursery School Education (28) of the Faculty of Education (University of Zaragoza), with an average age of 21.5.83 years old, participated in the study. They were randomly distributed into three experimental groups: group one, with traditional measures to promote physical activity; group two, using applications for mobile devices; group three, using physical activity bracelets. The IPAQ questionnaire was used to collect data on the amount of physical activity performed. Specifically, reasons for increased physical exercise were collected using theAMPEF questionnaire The results showed an improvement in the number of students fulfilling the healthy recommendations after seven weeks.

Therefore, it is crucial to understand positions and conflicts in society to achieve social acceptance. This paper analyses these positions using the example of implementing hydrogen and carbon capture and storage infrastructure to decarbonise the German energy system. The empirical basis of the study are explorative stakeholder interviews which were conducted with experts from politics, economics, civil society and science and analysed within a discursive and attitudinal framework using qualitative content analysis. These stakeholder positions are assumed to represent dominant social perceptions and reflect chances and risks for acceptance. The results indicate different positions while pursuing the common goal of addressing climate change. The general conflict concerns strategies towards a low-carbon society, especially the speed of phasing-out fossil energies. Regarding the combination of hydrogen and carbon capture and storage as instrument in the context of the energy transition, the stakeholder interviews indicate controversial as well as consensual perceptions. The assessments range from rejection to deeming it absolutely necessary. Controversial argumentations refer to security of supply, competitiveness and environmental protection. In contrast, consensus can be reached by balancing ecological and economic arguments, e.g. by linking hydrogen technologies with renewable and fossil energy sources or by limiting the use of carbon capture and storage only to certain applications (industry, bioenergy). In further decisions, this balancing of arguments combined with openness of technology, transparency of information and citizen participation need to be considered to achieve broad acceptance."

The study describes how robotics are effectively implemented in schools, based on computational concepts and the classroom activities. We describe, apply and present specific resources teachers, who may think of introducing programming and robotics in education must consider. These resources can be adapted to their students' levels and education stages. It is essential to be aware of the resources available and adapt them to students' needs. The analysis involves 107 fifth-grade students in primary education at three schools. The sample of the study was non-probabilistic and intentional. The study is bidimensional. The first dimension is a quasi-experimental design obtaining data from a test. Construct validity was tested by an exploratory factor analysis. The second dimension details the results for four scales previously described: active learning, computational concepts, perceived usefulness and enjoyment. This dimension examines the results of the aforementioned scale, which analyses the pedagogical interactions. Statistically significant improvements were achieved in the understanding of basic computational concepts such as sequences, loops, conditional statements, parallel execution, event handling and use of robotics. Improvements were also noted in didactic interaction, and in greater enjoyment, enthusiasm, efficiency and active participation of students. They also showed stronger motivation, commitment and interest in the process."

"WOS:000595588400002"	""	""	"The present contribution offers an assessment of the development and implementation of the digital participation system in Hamburg, Germany. The system utilises open and public planning data within a web-based interface and a physical decision-support tool. These technologies are integrated in urban planning processes, namely through citizen participation and citizen engagement. The research presented in this paper assesses the impact of the digital participation system by evaluating three key aspects shared with traditional citizen-participation methods: (1) the selection of participants, (2) the modes of communication used, and (3) the authority and power. The assessment is based on the analysis of data collected from interviews and a usability and user-experience study. For the analysis and comparison of DIPAS to other participation formats, this paper introduces a visual assessment tool, the participation cube. The digital participation system is found to have diversified the selection of participants and improved collaboration with the general public. However, it did not facilitate higher decisional power, due to the lack of legal adjustments. The author argues that new forms of participation should not only rely on digital tools, but should also engage with the institutional and procedural context in which participation occurs. Several strategies are suggested to support an interdisciplinary approach at the intersection of technical tools and traditional planning practices. These hybrid strategies would allow the seamless integration of citizen contributions into the creation of urban development plans."

The greatest removal was attained at pH 5, adsorbent weight of 0.5 g, initial heavy metal concentration of 10 mg/l, and a contact time of 60 minutes. The results revealed that bentonite clay is suitable in the removal of metal ions from polluted water. The ion exchange rate of lead was faster than that of copper. The isotherm for the adsorption of the lead and copper ions on bentonite clay was confirmed by the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms which offered good consequences. The results indicated that bentonite was utilized as an efficient ion exchange element for the removal of heavy metal ions from polluted water.

This waste oil showed free fatty acid content and a saponification value of 15.5 % and 199.7 mg KOH/g, respectively. The FFA content after esterification should be approximately 1.0%, not only to save glycerol and the catalyst involved in the esterification but also to achieve high biodiesel conversion during the transesterification. An alkaline catalyst was successfully used to produce biodiesel in the second step. A 97.6% conversion to biodiesel based on the European Standard EN 14214:2003 was achieved under the conditions (1.0% NaOH catalyst relative to waste oil, the molar ratio of free fatty acid, and methanol of 1:13.22, 60 degrees C, 1h). Overall, this novel two-step process achieved highly enhanced biodiesel conversion (74.6% to 100.0%) with a significantly increased molar ratio of free fatty acid and methanol (1:2.71 to 1:15.89) and catalyst requirements (1.0% NaOH)."

More precisely, face-to-face communication at classrooms now must rely on synchronous videoconferences which have digitally occupied the space that was previously regulated in ordinary lessons. It all required using a wide range of technological applications, amongst which Google Meet stood out as one of the most popular. Based on this, our study set itself two objectives: (1) identifying the communication needs that university students have felt throughout this period of virtual teaching; and (2) verifying the extent to which Google Meet succeeded in meeting those needs. Seeking to accomplish the aforesaid goals, we involved 52 students from the Degree in Primary Education Teacher Training imparted at the University of Alicante. A mixed methodological approach was adopted, the software programs utilized for data processing purposes being SPSS v. 25 and AQUAD 7, which enabled us to carry out a descriptive study and a content analysis, respectively. In view of the results, and although the teaching staff have used a synchronous type of audiovisual communication suited to the demands of students, the degree of satisfaction amongst the latter is remarkably low. Something similar happens when it comes to Google Meet because, despite recognizing that it has positive aspects such as a certain degree of usefulness and enjoyment, they claim to have had serious difficulties in using it. Such findings lead us to conclude that a compelling need exists to fine tune the technological response that universities are giving before the situation caused by COVID-19."

All treatments were done in triplicates. The results showed with increased stocking density, the electrical conductivity, total dissolved substances and salinity increased and dissolved oxygen decline.

Nevertheless, based on the conversion of fish feed to NO3-N and P per kilogram of feeds, the lowest stocking density provided the highest concentration of NO3-N and P.

Disturbance observers are employed to estimate and compensate for external constant and slowly time-varying disturbances, improving the robustness performance of the controller. A projection operator ensures that the estimates do not wind-up and that they remain within a prescribed bound. To validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed controller, we present and analyze both simulation and experimental results.

The group behavior of an ensemble is often modeled by a distribution, and thus the optimal control problem we study can be cast as a distribution steering problem. While most existing works for steering distributions require the agents in the ensemble to be indistinguishable, we consider the setting where agents have specified origin-destination constraints. This control problem also resembles a minimum cost network flow problem with a massive number of commodities. We propose a novel optimal transport based framework for this problem and derive an efficient algorithm for solving it. This framework extends multi-marginal optimal transport theory to settings with capacity and origin-destination constraints.

This is because most three-term algorithms are constructed using the classical CG method whose numerical performance has been tested and convergence proved. In this paper, we present a modification of RMIL+ CG method proposed by Dai [Z. Dai, Appl. Math. Comput., 267 (2016), 297-300] based on the convergence analysis of RMIL (2012) CG method. Interestingly, the modified method possesses sufficient descent condition and the global convergence prove was established using exact minimization condition. We further extended the results of the modified RMIL+ to construct a three-term CG algorithm and also show that the method satisfies the sufficient descent condition under the strong Wolfe line search. Preliminary numerical results are reported based on known benchmark problems which show that the proposed methods are efficient and promising compare to other CG methods."

Coronaviruses are a family of correlated viruses that induce iral infection. In humans. coronaviruses induce respiratory viral infections that may be mild or dangerous. The coronas irus shape is large circular elements that has e round tip outbreaks - the virus diameter particles=120 nm. The RNA viral genome occurs in coronavirus. The coronas irus genome size = 27-34 kilobases and this size is the largest RNA genome size, The Life cycle of coronavirus includes v iral entry replication and release. Coronas irus transmission was done through the connection of its protein with host cell receptors in a specific process. There are 4 types of coronas irus genus: (1) A 1phacoronavirus. (2) I3c facoronavir2r (3) Gammocoronovnws, and (4) ncttacwonavirus. Viral replication,, immune evasion and virion biogenesis correlated with host cell transformation mechanism. Viral molecular mechanism hijacks the host cell protein production mechanism. There is an important host factor (CPSF6) that connects with nuclear protein (NP 1). The CPSF6 increases the nuclear production of N P1 in the same time. CPSF6 possesses an important role in the progress of capsid mRNAs inside the nucleus. In a viral infection there is an increase in mRNA. myeloid differentiation 2 -related lipid recognition protein (ML). and Niemann Pick -type Cl (N PC) genes, Coronavirus is capable of replicating in in vin-o study and causes lower transcriptomic variations before 12 h after viral infection. As infection progress. coronas irus causes a significant dysregulation of the host transcriptome greater than the SARS virus. In conclusion. future transcriptome studies are the basis for detecting coronavirus in the human host and for developing a specific pro entis e and therapeutic method for the virus."

The withdrawal of the United States from global climate and migration agendas, added to the anti-migration policy of North America and the European Union, are producing imbalances, which in the near future could threaten global human security, hence, reflection on the concept takes on special relevance; above all, when Donald Trump's national security speech legitimizes actions to the detriment of international human security; despite the fact that this is inherent to the human being and incorporates the importance of meeting basic needs."

The effects of main parameters, including desorption temperature and time were evaluated on the performance and carryover of the prepared NTDs. Moreover, the repeatability, reproducibility and stability of the developed sampler were investigated for the sampling and determination of the interest analytes. The results of experiments indicated that the highest peak area was obtained at desorption temperature and time of 250 degrees C and 3 min, respectively. The reproducibility of the proposed method was investigated with three distinct NTDs with similar structure. The weight of the adsorbent was also obtained. The results showed that the relative standard deviation (RSD) of experiments was in the range of 0.2-9.7%. The RSD of repeatability was obtained at four different concentrations with three times replications less than 15%. The limit of detection and quantitation (LOD and LOQ) for the studied VOCs ranged from 0.01 to 0.14 ng ml(-1) and 0.04 to 0.48 ng ml(-1), respectively. Also, the storage stability of the analytes of interest in the NTD-HAP/PA after 3 and 7 days at 4 degrees C was above 95 and 93%, respectively. It can be concluded that the proposed method could be applied as a desirable and powerful tool for air sampling and microextraction of volatile organic compounds."

This work presents a specific heuristic for evaluating educational games, created from Game User Experience Satisfaction (GUESS) and, concomitantly, Nielsen's assessment tools. To this purpose, applied research using a quantitative-qualitative approach - with the participation of 3 specialized users and 4 potential users in an educational game used as a case study. The choice of GUESS as a starting point was due to a systematic review of the usability literature. Based on the model, users were invited to operate the educational game and present their impressions. From the selected results, a new use assessment tool, called E-GUESS, was formulated. With Educational-GUESS, we introduced changes aimed at pedagogical issues and educational content that also seeks to elucidate important points in the development of an educational game by allowing insights that are easily ignored during the design phase to overcome the alleged bipolarity between fun and educational in educational software games. Another contribution of the research was the usability analysis performed for the educational game used in data collection.

First, a hybrid automaton approach is applied to model the dynamics of the DAB converter. Then the optimal feedback policy of a quadruple-phase-shift is obtained via solving a peak current minimization problem with DAB converter dynamics and transferred power constraints. A randomized optimization approach is applied to solve the problem. The proposed control scheme is validated by numerical simulation and compared with the traditional double-phase-shift and triple-phase-shift policies. The simulation results verify that the proposed quadruple-phase-shift method has better performance regarding the current stress."	"This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI under Grant 18K13237.

The semantic web vision promotes a daily expanding of the semantic graph that requires some processing enhancements including SPARQL end-point and federated queries to apprehend the endless expansion. The current advanced high-performance computing architecture has been developing rapidly to overcome many issues including performance. High-performance computing can potentially be employed to improve the federated SPARQL query and overall operation including the performance and processing. Thus, this work reviews the techniques to progress the development on separated and remote federated semantic-based data. That is, the high-performance computing environment including hardware architecture and special architecture computing has been surveyed. Moreover, operating semantic graph integration necessities is analyzed. Furthermore, the existing techniques to improve SPARQL performance are studied. Besides, an investigation about the utilization of advanced hardware computing architecture is reviewed in order to enhance the execution of the current SPARQL federation service operation."

"WOS:000587503200005"	""	""	"Although Big data analytics, machine learning and cloud technologies have been acknowledged as better enablers in revolutionizing the quality of agricultural systems, in most of the developing nations like India there is no able system to effectively survey the real grocery needs of the society and accordingly educate the farmers to grow and supply the crops. Due to lack of such process, there is no synchronization between demand and supply of food crops, and hence, most of the time farmers suffer with loss and consumers suffer from high varied prices. In order to address this problem, data about the demand, supply, and price variation of various crops of different seasons of the year have been collected and analysed. The analysis results have shown a huge gap between demand and supply of crops. Hence, this work proposes novel machine learning-based data analytics system that forecasts the demand for different food crops and regulates the supply accordingly by assisting the farmers in growing the crops based on the demand. Implementation results have shown 92% reduction in the gap."

With the advancements of computational biology, neuroimaging techniques have been used extensively in clinical data analysis. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric disorder, with the symptomology of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, in which early diagnosis is crucial to prevent unwelcome outcomes. This study addresses ADHD identification using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data for the resting state brain by evaluating multiple feature extraction methods. The features of seed-based correlation (SBC), fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF), and regional homogeneity (ReHo) are comparatively applied to obtain the specificity and sensitivity. This helps to determine the best features for ADHD classification using convolutional neural networks (CNN). The methodology using fALFF and ReHo resulted in an accuracy of 67%, while SBC gained an accuracy between 84% and 86% and sensitivity between 65% and 75%."
