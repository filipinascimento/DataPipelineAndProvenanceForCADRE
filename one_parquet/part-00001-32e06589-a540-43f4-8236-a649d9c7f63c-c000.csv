We derive a closed-form expression for the minimal information data rate from the coder to the controller necessary to achieve stabilization of the system. In particular, it is shown that the evaluation of the minimal data rate for stabilization reduces to the computation of the Lyapunov exponent of some lifted switched linear system, obtained from the original one by using tools from multilinear algebra, and thus can benefit from well-established algorithms for the computation of the Lyapunov exponent. In a second time, drawing upon this expression, we describe a practical coder-controller that stabilizes the system, and whose data rate can be as close as desired to the optimal data rate."

In the present work, the crystal structures of wild and mutant type PBP2 were analyzed to identify structural changes leading to antibiotic resistance. Other than these two targets, three other targets were generated by analyzing possible hot spots for mutations in PBP2. By using a reverse screening approach, fifteen molecules were screened and processed for ligand binding analysis with all five targets. The analysis of the above studies suggested that two compounds Guanosine 5-diphosphate and Thymidine 3', 5-diphosphate show the good binding affinity than Ceftriaxone and other compounds. Further, we have generated ten novel compounds using Ceftriaxone, Guanosine 5-diphosphate, and Thymidine 3', 5-diphosphate. To identify the novel findings, all novel compounds were docked against aforesaid five targets. The studies resulted in the finding of three best molecules that may be considered as suitable, potent, and generic inhibitors against N. gonorrhoeae other than Ceftriaxone"	"We would like to thank the Tezpur University and UGC, India for the start-up grant and DBT funded Bioinformatics Infrastructure facility in the Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at Tezpur University for providing us computational facility to carry out this research work."

Three study groups were used: 1) Control group (CG) that remained seated within the class; 2) Experimental group 1 (EG1) that made 1 active break of 4 minutes at low intensity; and 3) Experimental group 2 (EG2) that carried out high intensity exercises. To analyze the effects of the different types of breaks, ANCOVA was used with repeated measures 3 Group (CG, EG1, EG2) x 2 Time (pre, post). Age, sex and studies of the mother were used as covariates. The results showed that active rest improved the participants' later memory (p <0.001). The low intensity active breaks had a similar improvement effect in attention and concentration (21 and 25%, p <0.001). Improvements in the mathematical calculation were observed after both types of active breaks, however, the differences have not become significant. The adolescents showed no improvement in linguistic ability or creativity. It is suggested the inclusion of active breaks, preferably at low intensity, to obtain short-term benefits in the attention, concentration and mathematical calculation in secondary school youth."

This was applied clinically and investigated for multiple disease sites (10 prostate, 5 liver, and 5 lung) using a radiotherapy optimization software (MonArc), where these new constraints were added to conventional dosimetric constraints. For all the investigated sites, three fiducial markers were located inside or around the planning target volume (PTV), and VMAT plans were created for each patient. We modified MonArc to analyze the multi-leaf collimator (MLC) beam's-eye-view at all control points in the gantry arc, while including marker-based visibility constraints of type 'hard' (i.e. requiring 100% visibility of all markers, HC) and 'soft' (i.e. penalizes visibility for one marker [SCI] or two markers [SCII] only) in the optimization process. Dose distributions resulting from the constrained plans (HC, SCI, and SCII) were compared to the non-constrained plan (NC-plans optimized without visibility constraints) using several quantitative dose metrics including the conformity index, homogeneity index, doses to PTV and to organs-at-risk (OAR). Generally, the NC plan produced the best PTV dose conformity and the least OAR doses for the entire patient datasets, followed by the SC and then HC plans, with all the optimization approaches typically achieving acceptable dose metrics. Across the three disease sites, visibility of all three markers in MLC apertures increased from 32% to 100% of available control points as visibility constraints strengthened. Although dose metrics showed some deterioration for constrained plans (-6% for SCI up to -15% for HC using the PTV average index), the required dosimetric objectives were still satisfied in at least 90% of patients. In conclusion, we demonstrated that marker and tumour visibility constraints can be incorporated with dosimetric objectives to produce treatment plans satisfying both objectives, which should ensure greater success when applying real-time tracking for VMAT delivery."

As humans can process their memories, likewise video and images can be processed and perceptive with the help of computer vision technology. There is a broad range of fields that have great speculation and concepts building in the area of application of computer vision, which includes automobile, biomedical, space research, etc. The case study in this manuscript enlightens one about the innovation and future scope possibilities that can start a new era in the biomedical image-processing sector. A pre-surgical investigation can be perused with the help of the proposed technology that will enable the doctors to analyses the situations with deeper insight. There are different types of biomedical imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomographic (CT) scan, x-ray imaging. The focused arena of the proposed research is x-ray imaging in this subset. As it is always error-prone to do an eyeball check for a human when it comes to the detailing. The same applied to doctors. Subsequently, they need different equipment for related technologies. The methodology proposed in this manuscript analyses the details that may be missed by an expert doctor. The input to the algorithm is the image in the format of x-ray imaging; eventually, the output of the process is a label on the corresponding objects in the test image. The tool used in the process also mimics the human brain neuron system. The proposed method uses a convolutional neural network to decide on the labels on the objects for which it interprets the image. After some pre-processing the x-ray images, the neural network receives the input to achieve an efficient performance.

Little is known about the context in which they provide HIV/AIDS-related care, and their role as caregivers is most often not documented. This study conducted interviews with 31 elderly carers to explore their care-giving activities in relation to adult children with AIDS-related illness, and to examine their perceived role in HIV prevention and management in rural communities in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. The findings indicate that older adults who assume the natural role of caring for sick adult children live in multigenerational households. Key caring activities include the provision of physical and hygiene care, financial and emotional support, and health and nutritional care. Besides the physical caring activities, the elderly carers play a critical role in the prevention of HIV. They promoted condom use, encouraged HIV testing, and spoke openly about the HIV status of their sick adult children. Their critical role in administering antiretroviral treatment (ART) and encouraging adherence demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the importance of adherence and the complex ART regimen. The findings underscore the need to train and incorporate older adults into adherence programmes to facilitate their role as long-term adherence partners. They are also an essential vehicle to reduce stigma and discrimination in their communities."

It is necessary to explore factors that potentially accelerate this improvement process. Like various other significant yet unexplored aspects, it is equally essential to establish a performative (fusion of accuracy and efficiency) insight about players' cognition (memory, vision, and analytics) among the different modes of brain games. This paper presents empirical research (n = 117) that investigates the impact of different modes of brain games (single vs. multiplayer) upon the players' cognitive performance. An accumulated result of the research revealed that the cognitive performance in memory stimulating and visual activity-oriented brain games play significantly boosts during multiplayer mode. Similarly, cognitive accuracy in analytical brain gameplay also increases during the multiplayer mode; however, it's rather inefficient. In addition, both the components of cognitive performance in single-player mode are reported as negatively correlated, while in the multiplayer mode it's rather contrary."

Various ongoing researches have been searching for the new drug candidate against COVID-19 infection. The research objective is based on the molecular docking study of inhibition of the main protease of COVID-19 by natural compounds found in Allium sativum and Allium cepa. Lipinski rule of five and Autodock 4.2 was used by using the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm to perform Molecular docking to analyze the probability of docking. Further, ADME analysis was also performed by using SwissADME, which is freely available on the web. In the present study, we identified S-Allylcysteine sulfoxide (Alliin), S-Propyl cysteine, S-Allylcysteine, S-Ethylcysteine, S-Allylmercaptocysteine, S-Methylcysteine, S-propyl L-cysteine with binding energies (-5.24, -4.49, -4.99, -4.91, -4.79, -4.76, -5.0 kcal/mol) as potential inhibitor candidates for COVID-19. Out of 7 selected compounds, alliin showed the best binding efficacy with target protein 6LU7. In silico ADME analysis revealed that these compounds are expected to have a standard drug-like property as well. Our findings propose that natural compounds from garlic and onion can be used as potent inhibitors against the main protease of COVID-19, which could be helpful in combating the COVID-19 pandemic."

In the United States and worldwide, it is becoming a major cause in hospital admissions as well as an increase in morbidity and mortality. The rising total cost of care for COPD is concerning for all health care industries. The disease has significant impact on the patient's quality of life and psychological well-being. A worldwide initiative is underway in developing a care model that is multifactorial through continuous monitoring of patients to manage and control symptoms, achieve medication adherence, and provide socioeconomic resources. The primary aim of this study was to prevent exacerbations, hospital admissions, and readmissions. Various models have shown positive results; however, the significant financial investment is the major barrier to success. Recently, one health system in the United States was able to improve care, decrease readmissions, and reduce total cost of care by investing in a multidisciplinary team of specialists. In the utilization of the care model, the primary endpoint will conclude that COPD is financially and socioeconomically manageable."

A decentralized supervisory controller is synthesized based on control barrier functions (CBF) that guarantees obstacle avoidance with limited actuation capability. The proposed method is applicable to general nonlinear robot dynamics and is scalable to an arbitrary number of agents. Agent-to-agent communication is not required, yet a simple broadcasting scheme improves the performance of the algorithm. The key idea is based on a control barrier function constructed with a backup controller, and we show that by assuming other agents respecting the same CBF condition, the supervisory control algorithm can be implemented decentrally and guarantees obstacle avoidance for all agents."

The objective of this study was to examine the in vitro effect of Brassica oleracea L. var. pekinensis (Chinese cabbage) juice, methanol extract of Hibiscus rosa sinensis (Hibiscus) yellow flower and Tradescantia zebrina pendula leaves, respectively on CYP 3A4 activity in rat liver microsomes. Differential centrifugation method was used to isolate microsomes from the rat livers. The concentration of formaldehyde released from N-demethylation of aminopyrine in rat liver microsomes was determined. Based on the results obtained, B. oleracea juice at 100 ng/mL and 1000 g/mL significantly reduced CYP3A4 activity when compared to the control group. On the other hand, methanol extract of Hibiscus yellow flower and T. zebrina leaves at 1, 10, 100, and 1000 ng/mL significantly increased the metabolism of aminopyrine by enhancing CYP3A4 activity when compared to the control group. Our findings suggested that Chinese cabbage juice, methanol extract of Hibiscus yellow flower, and T. zebrina leaves could have the potential to interact with the metabolism of aminopyrine in rat liver microsomes by modulating the hepatic CYP activity."

Data were collected from a number of cases and control groups, which was preprocessed to be fit for the analysis. Risk factors were extracted by comparing two different approaches one is machine learning, and another is the statistical approach. A common regulatory pattern was found that leads to the design of an algorithm that gives a predictive result of the risk level of any user for Type-1 Diabetes.

In this paper, two deep learning models (Long short term memory (LSTM) and Bi-directional long short term memory (BLSTM)) are proposed to classify the condition of gearbox into good or bad. These models are applied on aircraft gearbox vibration data in both time and frequency domain. A publicly available aircraft gearbox vibration dataset is used to evaluate the performance of proposed models. The results proved that accuracy achieved by LSTM and BLSTM are highly reliable and applicable in health monitoring of aircraft gearbox system in time domain as compared to frequency domain. Also, to show the superiority of proposed models for aircraft gearbox fault diagnosis, performance is compared with classical machine learning models."

The exact Fisher's test was considered to analzse between-period category changes, followed by a Repeated Measures ANOVA, to compare the results in both approaches. Although agility showed significant improvements following training, larger in T1 compared to T2, the percentage of independent participants was higher in T2. In terms of detraining, paired comparison showed larger losses during D2. However, more than half of participants reached the physical independence during this second period.

Motivated by the quadrotor application, in which position control has higher priority over yaw control for safety reasons, we embed in the anti-windup synthesis procedure the possibility to prioritize the level of performance degradation during saturation for the different system outputs."

Learning the quadrotor flight in a standard RL approach requires many iterations of trial and error, which may bring about risky exploration and battery consumption. In this letter, we integrate a classical controller such as PD (proportional and derivative) or LQR (linear quadratic regulator) with a RL policy using their linear combination. The proposed method is not only simple to use, but also fast in learning convergence. When the algorithm is evaluated for a quadrotor trajectory tracking by means of a velocity control for both simulation and experiment, it demonstrates the faster convergence rate and better control performance in comparison with an existing rapid model-based RL method."

It starts from the concept of the human being as a historical, vulnerable being, situated in a circumstance, and of ethics as a comparative response to the other in their situation of vulnerability and need. Cognitive pedagogy. having dispensed with experience, has been forced to use moral judgment as an adequate (and unique) strategy to promote and facilitate moral conduct, according to Kantian ethics. A biased, mutilated conception of man cannot account for how he responds to the demand of the other in his concrete situation. Education is conceived as accompaniment, welcome and comparative response to the other, as a new birth and the beginning of something new. It is proposed .another way, of educating that has experience as the nucleus of educational action. This model of education translates into: a) abandonment of idealistic philosophy; b) political and social commitment; c) presence of experience in the educational process; d) presence of compassionate ethics as its backbone; e) a new discourse and a new language; f) the teacher's testimony as a reference to the experience of ethical values: and g) narration as a privileged instrument for educational action.

"WOS:000595516900001"	""	""	"Bone is a dynamic biological tissue that acts as the primary rigid support of the body. Several systemic factors are responsible for pathologies that negatively affect its structural attributes. Although the bone is in continuous renewal by osteogenesis, metabolic diseases are the most common affectations that alter its natural equilibrium. Different techniques based on ionizing radiation are used for the bone diagnosis restrictively. However, if these are not used adequately, the application could present risks for human health. In this paper, it is proposed and explored a new technique to apply an early-stage diagnosis of bone variations. The technique evaluates bone structural conditions from the teeth (used as probes) by applying a structural health monitoring (SHM) methodology. An experimental procedure is described to identify the stiffness variations produced by mechanical drillings done in prepared bone samples. The identification is carried out applying the electromechanical impedance technique (EMI) through a piezo-actuated device in the frequency spectrum 5-20kHz. Three bone samples with incorporated teeth (three teeth, two teeth, and one tooth) were prepared to emulate a mandibular portion of alveolar bone-PDL (periodontal ligament)-tooth system. Piezo-device was attached to the crown of the tooth with an orthodontic bracket allowing the teeth to act as probes. The electrical resistance measurements were computed with an electrical decoupling approach that improved the detection of the drillings; it was due to the increment of the sensitivity of the signals. The results showed that the bone mass reduction is correlated with statistical indices obtained in specific frequency intervals of the electrical resistance. This work suggests the possibility of a future application addressed to a bone diagnosis in a non-invasive way."

Iceberg). The experiment was performed employing a floating bioreactor system where modified atmosphere package conditions were mimicked, and fresh-cut lettuce disks of 2 cm(2) were put into contact with a 10(6) CFU/mL of a phenotypic mucoid P. aeruginosa phenotype (muc(+) ) or a non-mucoid one (muc(-)). Following a simulated 2-day refrigerated-shelf quantitative Real-Time PCR, designed on a target gene region of the 16S rRNA gene, defined the different muc phenotypes behavior on biofilm in lettuce phyllo-plane. Between the two strains, a development difference of nearly 1.0 log CFU/cm(2) occurred, with the muc(+) phenotype being the most settled and adherent. This result clearly showed a distinct contamination risk according to P. aeruginosa phenotype and the need to develop real-time, specific, fast, and easy to use detection protocols along with specific sanitation systems for modified atmosphere package ready-toeat commodities"	"This research was funded by the project Real Time Check IV Gamma - Por Fesr 2014/2020 - Asse Prioritario I Ricerca Scientifica, Sviluppo Tecnologico e Innovazione."

Contrary to most data-driven approaches for nonlinear systems, we determine dissipativity properties over all finite time horizons using noisy input-state data. To this end, we propose two noise characterizations to deduce two data-based set-membership representations of the ground-truth system. Each representation then serves as a framework to derive computationally tractable conditions to verify dissipativity properties with rigorous guarantees from noise-corrupted data using sum of squares (SOS) optimization."

An application to the problem of glucose regulation is then presented, showing the effectiveness of the approach taken."

The idea is to engineer a synthetic microbial consortium consisting of three different cell populations. In such a consortium, two populations, the Togglers, responding to some reference input, can induce the switch of a bistable memory mechanism in a third population, the Targets, so as to activate or deactivate some additional functionalities in the cells. Communication among the three populations is established by orthogonal quorum sensing molecules that are used to close a feedback control loop across the populations. The control design is validated via in-silico experiments in BSim, a realistic agent-based simulator of bacterial populations."

First, we formulate a framework for the two interdependent MJLSs to capture the interactions between various entities in the system, where the modes of the system cannot be observed directly. Instead, a signal which contains information of the modes can be observed. Then, depending on the scope of the available system state information (global or local), we design centralized and distributed controllers, respectively, that can stochastically stabilize the overall interdependent MJLS. In addition, we derive the sufficient stabilization conditions for the system under both types of information structure.

The structural and techno-functional properties of cassava starches, both native and modified, were evaluated via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), baking properties, as well as, resistance to freezing and thawing cycles. The native sample containing 17% of amylose had the highest expansion rate among the tested starches. In contrast, pre-gelatinized acetylated starches showed little expansion capacity. The starch samples displayed resistance to up to 2 freezing and thawing cycles. The XRD analysis showed that native and modified starches had high crystallinity and similar diffraction patterns. SEM images revealed that modified starches possess smaller particles (32 to 52 mu m) with a greater surface area when compared to the native samples. Modified samples also displayed surface indentations, which would explain their greater water absorption potential. TGA analysis has shown a reduction (P<0.05) in the modified starches thermal stability. These data are relevant technological advancement of the cheese bun industry since choosing adequate starch is crucial to ensure the final product's quality in large scale industrial production."

Presently, water quality is carried out through laboratory experiments. which requires costly reagents. skilled labor and consumes time. Thereby making it necessary to search for an alternative method.

In this study. the potentials of one of the machine learning tools (artificial neural network) were explored in the predictions and estimation of the Kelantan River basin. Water quality data collected from the 14 stations of the River basin was used for modeling and predicting (WQP). As for WQP analysis. the results obtained from this study show that the best prediction was obtained from the prediction of pH. The low kurtosis values of pH indicate that the appearance of outliers give a negative impact on the performance. As for WOP analysis for each station. we found that the WQP prediction in station 1. 2. and 3 give the good results. This is related to the available data of those stations that are more than the a ailable data in other stations. except station 8."

The main objective of this plan is to carry out an educational experience from the Flipped Learning pedagogical approach, in the area of technical training for soccer referees and assistants. Thus, this article makes an approach to the scenario resulting from its development, which is characterized by a modular structure and by the two spaces and differentiated training times. In the first, participants establish a first contact with the didactic material prepared by the teaching team for each module, and work on it before the corresponding training session. In the second, trainers accompany, streamline, and guide the activities proposed in each of the face-to-face sessions for teamwork, organize the debates and moderate the discussions. In this way, a horizontal communicative and educational approach is sought, and contrary to the unidirectional and transmissive model that has characterized the training of this group for the work on the content of the rules of the game. The results of the evaluation of the experience are very positive in relation to the degree of the objectives proposed in the project, the educational resources used, and the methodological strategies addressed to promote participation, interaction, and collaboration among participants.

Two of the most studied genetic polymorphisms in relation to sports performance in the last decade are ACTN3 R577X and ACE I/D. The aim of this study was to summarize the possible associations of both polymorphisms and the performance in soccer players, determining the allelic and genotypic combination that stands out the most in this population and, also, to observe their relationships at the physical and physiological level. In order to complete this study, two phases were carried out, the first one of literature review in databases (Pubmed, Scopus and Sportdiscus) and, the second one which covered the information classification and analysis. The studies show a greater influence of the ACE-D and ACTN-R alleles, and higher presence of the ACE-ID and ACTN-RR genotypes. Subjects with these combinations were found to perform better on speed and strength tests. On the other hand, the ACTN3 polymorphism is directly related to muscle injuries. In conclusion, a relationship between genetic polymorphisms and performance in soccer players could be observed. Genetic components can be integrated as a new component within the characterization of sport and as a tool within a model of identification and detection of talents in youth soccer. In addition, genetic biomarkers could be responsible, in the future, for the study of the risk of injury so that performance in professional soccer is much more optimized."

Based on this novel concept, the interactions between light and biological matter can be exploited in many circumstances as useful tools in various fields of science and technology. In fact, it is surprising as well as exciting that the optical behavior of living cells permits their use as microlenses for imaging, photonic microresonators or optical waveguides. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that biological cells can behave as advanced probes for optical tweezing, able to manipulate matter at the nanoscale and also as subwavelength probes of localized fluorescence. Here, we present an overview of these fascinating applications of biological lenses. The aim of the present Topical Review is to introduce a completely new scenario to the community of scientists working in optics and photonics. A developing research field is presented, in which live cells can be employed and exploited as optical components for incredible applications ranging from simple imaging, to manipulation of soft matter, to biomedical diagnosis. Several of the most significant studies and discoveries will be illustrated and discussed."

Respondents said they learned the need for adaptability and good planning, emphasizing doing what it takes to serve their students. There was high variability in most answers, indicating that the experiences of individual teachers ranged widely between positive and negative.

However, this doesn't mean that MVP can't cause any problems. In malignant conditions, MVP can cause mitral failure and also heart failure. Early diagnosis of MVP is significantly important to control and reduce its complications. Since the phonocardiogram signal provides useful information about heart valves function, it can be used for MVP detection. To detect MVP, the signal was denoised and segmented into heart cycles and constant three-second pieces in the first and second approaches, respectively. Next, based on the Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT), the desired features were extracted. Then, the extracted features were windowed by a Moving Logarithmic Median Window (MLMW) and optimum features were selected using Mahalanobis, Bhattacharyya, Canberra, and Minkowski distance criteria. Finally, using the selected features, classification was performed by using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and the Suppor Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to find out whether a segment is prolapsed. The best results of the experiment on the collected database contain 15 prolapsed and 6 non-prolapsed subjects using the A-test method show 96.25 +/- 2.43 accuracy, 98.5 +/- 3.37 sensitivity, 94.0 +/- 5.16 specificity, 96.0 +/- 3.44 precision, 92.5 +/- 4.86 kappa, and 96.6 +/- 2.34 f-score with the SVM classifier."

The focus of this study was to engage a global network of laboratories to experimentally quantify the pH-dependent solubility of the highest therapeutic dose of 16 APIs using a harmonized protocol. Intra-laboratory variability was <= 5 %, and no apparent association of inter-laboratory variability with API solubility was discovered. Final classification low solubility vs high solubility was consistent among laboratories. In comparison to the literature-based provisional 2006 WHO BCS classification, three compounds were reclassified from high to low-solubility. To estimate the consequences of these experimental solubility results on BCS classification, dose-adjusted in silico predictions of the fraction absorbed in humans were performed using GastroPlus (R). Further expansion of these experimental efforts to qualified APIs from the WHO Essential Medicines List is anticipated to empower regulatory authorities across the globe to issue scientifically-supported guidance regarding the necessity of performing in vivo bioequivalence studies. Ultimately, this will improve access to affordable generic products, which is a critical prerequisite to reach Universal Health Coverage. (c) 2021 by the authors.

However, most work done so far has focused on learning control laws for individual tasks. Simultaneously learning multiple tasks on the same system is still a largely unaddressed research question. In particular, no efficient state space exploration schemes have been designed for multi-task control settings. Using this research gap as our main motivation, we present an algorithm that approximates the smallest data set that needs to be collected in order to achieve high performance across multiple control tasks. By describing system uncertainty using a probabilistic Gaussian process model, we are able to quantify the impact of potentially collected data on each learning-based control law. We then determine the optimal measurement locations by solving a stochastic optimization problem approximately.

The objective of this study is in-silico designing and docking of coumarin-amino acidconjugates against integrin like protein of Cryptococcus neoformans. In the absence of a crystallographic structure of integrin of the fungal pathogen, a homology model of protein OXH63806.1 of Cryptococcus neoformans was developed using the currently available X-ray structure of humanintegrin as a template. The quality of the 3D model obtained by homology modeling was evaluated by the PROCHECK program. A docking study using coumarin-amino acid(s) conjugates as ligands on the binding site of the modeled receptor was carried out to understand the protein-ligand bindinginteractions. Some of the compounds have shown very good binding energies ranging from -10.32 to -10.94 Kcal/mol towards the target receptor. These results may be helpful in the designing and development of new antifungal agents as integrin like protein antagonists."

Cow's milk is a complete food product containing proteins, fats, carbohydrates and minerals. But it often causes allergic reactions that seriously affect the absorption and use of nutrients in dairy products: the main allergen is beta-lactoglobulin. Regulatory regions of the BLG gene in sheep, goats, and cattle are used as part of genetic constructs. The article provides a brief overview of successful experiments in the world practice on editing the beta-lactoglobulin gene in cattle and goats using genomic editing methods, in particular the CRISPR / Cas9 technology. The article reports on the creation of a ready-made set of crispr / Cas9 components in plasmid form for microinjection into the pronucleus of bovine zygotes in order to knock out the BLG gene and replace it with the gene of a biologically active target protein, as well as a well-thought-out strategy for analyzing its possible modifications."

The purpose of this study is to identify the impact of incident x-ray beam angle on the accuracy of indirect PSD calculation and develop a correction method. Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to assist analytical equation derivation and to validate the developed analytical method. Direct PSD measurements were performed a Siemens Artis Zee biplane fluoroscopy and a GE OEC C-Arm at different angles to validate the proposed correction method and its independence of fluoroscopy systems. Compared with MC simulated PSD, the derived analytical equation successfully predicts these PSD changes for incident angles of 0, 15, 30 and 40 degrees, with the residual error magnitude of 0.3%-3.1% corresponding to different SSDs.

The consequences of nonstandard scheduling extend to workers, their spouse, and children, urging greater attention to the distribution of nonstandard schedules at the couple-level. Using all three waves of the National Survey of Families and Households, this article examines the prevalence, persistence and sociodemographic patterns of rotating and night employment at the couple-level, following 913 married couples in the United States as they aged from the late 1980s to early 2000s. Though aging reduced the likelihood that couples had one or both spouses working nonstandard hours, roughly one-third of couples with nonstandard scheduling continued to experience nonstandard schedules during the subsequent observation period. Nonstandard schedules were stratified by education and race/ethnicity. This stratification persisted as couples aged, even after controlling for prior work schedules. Findings suggest that disadvantaged couples remain disproportionately exposed to schedules associated with negative outcomes for family well-being across the life course."

It examines the relationship of these technologies to local public health initiatives, and how the privacy debate over these apps made the technology in some cases less responsive to public health agency needs. The article suggests that as countries enter the return to normal phase, the more important and more invasive contact tracing and disease surveillance technologies will be deployed at the local level in the context of employment, transit, retail services, and other activities. The smart city may be co-opted for COVID-19 surveillance, and individuals will experience tracking and monitoring as they go to work, shop, dine, and commute. The author questions whether the attention given to national contact tracing apps has overshadowed more local contexts where privacy, ethical, and human rights issues remain deeply important but relatively unexamined.

Based on data from the 2016 Intergenerational Social Mobility Module, compiled by INEGI (2017) as part of the National Household Survey, our findings indicate that all the ethnic-racial characteristics studied (self-classification, indigenous language and skin tone) are associated in a statistically significant way with people's economic destinies, with the linguistic dimension having the largest effect. Ethnic-racial self-classification, particularly mestizo or white rather than indigenous, has a smaller effect than that observed for the linguistic dimension, yet a greater one than skin tone. We find that these associations are statistically significant even when socioeconomic origins are controlled for, suggesting that economic inequalities can be explained by both the historical accumulation of disadvantages and the persistence of racist and discriminatory practices in the present."

At the top of these systems is enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems that integrate HEIs' business processes, functions, and data to improve their overall productivity and effectiveness. However, many studies on ERP adoption have shown that organizations frequently face several barriers, and the failure rate is high. In addition, various research projects have concluded that, quite often, HEIs do not obtain the expected advantages from the adoption of the ERP system. This research aims to explore the factors that affect the behavioral adoption and acceptance of an ERP system in the context of HEIs. Based on works from literature and authors' observations of the PeopleSoft system (ERP system) implementation at Yanbu University College (YUC) in Yanbu City, Saudi Arabia (SA), a conceptual model of users' acceptance of ERP systems has been proposed. The framework is based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model and is extended with additional constructs. The present study offers a theoretical contribution by extending the UTAUT model to provide a richer understanding of users' adoption behavior of ERP systems in the HEI context. In addition, according to the authors' knowledge, this is the first paper that to address ERP users' adoption perspective in HEIs in SA."

The task is challenging due to the hybrid nature of dynamics and contact constraints. We encode the hybrid dynamics and constraints into Riemannian inner product, and this inner product is defined so that short curves correspond to admissible motions for the system. We rely on the affine geometric heat flow to deform an arbitrary path connecting the desired initial and final states to this admissible motion. The method is able to automatically find the trajectory of robot's center of mass, feet contact positions and forces on uneven terrain."

The surface of WAC is characterized to know the mechanism of adsorption reaction and the effect of different adsorption parameters like pH, temperature, contact period, adsorbate and adsorbent doses are also studied for the said adsorption study. The optimum contact times for MB and MG adsorption on WAC are 60 and 120 minutes respectively, whereas pH is having no significant effect on adsorption. However, % adsorption increases slowly with the increase of pH from 2.5 to 7. Adsorption of both the dyes on WAC is exothermic, spontaneous, and favorable in nature. Langmuir isotherm and pseudo-second-order kinetics are obeyed well. Langmuir's maximum monolayer adsorption capacities are found to be 15.38 and 18.87mg/g for MB and MG, respectively. Temkin isotherm, and Morris-Weber equations are also obeyed well. Temkin's isotherm concludes the physicochemical nature of adsorption, and Morris Weber equation indicates possibilities of intraparticle diffusion. The interaction between these two cationic dyes and WAC can be explained through electrostatic force of attraction or by hydrogen bonding."

Background: Timolol maleate is a BCS class I drug used as the first line of treatment in open-angle glaucoma. The rapid precorneal elimination of conventional formulation containing class I drugs exhibits poor therapeutic effect and bioavailability. So, in situ gelling system was formulated and characterized. Methods: Box-Behnken design was used to statistically optimize the formulation parameters and evaluate the effects of formulation attributes, namely concentration of gellan gum (X-1), the concentration of carbopol 934P (X-2) and concentration of benzododecenium bromide (X-3) on selected critical quality attributes (Y-1-Y-7). Trial run data were statistically analyzed using the polynomial equation and response surface plots. Optimized formulation was selected based on desirability function, design space, and was further characterized and compared with the marketed formulation. Results: The concentration of both polymers showed a synergistic positive impact on viscosity at the non-physiological and physiological conditions. Trial runs showed controlled drug release with diffusion-controlled mechanism and good mucoadhesive strength due to the presence of Carbopol 934P. The preservative benzododecenium bromide showed the ability to enhance trans-corneal permeation. The optimized formulation has appeared as a clear solution at the non-physiological condition and clear gel at the physiological condition with an acceptable pH range of 5-6. Other quality attributes like rheological properties, gelling capacity, texture analysis, Isotonicity, contact angle, sterility, antimicrobial efficacy, and stability were found in desires values for the ocular application. The safety of in situ gel for human use was confirmed by ocular irritation and histopathology studies in the rabbit eyes. The intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction with optimized formulation was found comparable and less fluctuating compared to ophthalmic gel-forming marketed solution of timolol maleate (TIMOPTIC-XE (R) ). Conclusion: The cross-linking between Carbopol 934P with Gellan gum in the formation showed more viscous gelling at the physiological condition to provide long pre-corneal residence time. The optimized formulation exhibited all the desirable attributes of an ideal ophthalmic in situ gelling formulation, exhibited in-vitro controlled drug release, good gelling capacity, and was found to be stable and non-irritant to the eye."

The evidence is applied to the CEPGL (Communaute Economique des Pays des Grands Lacs) region. Previous studies have concluded either to the absence of connection between the two spheres, to a unidirectional or bidirectional relationship, or to a differentiated connection depending on the economic status of development of the country. The research design applied in this research has been inspired by the reality of the region by running an Error Correction Model for each country and a fixed effects model on panel data for the whole region. Therefore, we estimated econometric models from a series of macroeconomic data relating to the depth, and the accessibility of the financial system. The data used in this study range from 1976 to 2013. Insights from this study show that the financial system of the region is extremely underdeveloped, a weak connection between the financial and the economic sphere, in addition to an ambivalent sense of causality."
