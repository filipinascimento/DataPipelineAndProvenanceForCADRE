"WOS:000543958500006"	""	""	"Fast covariance intersection is a widespread technique for state estimate fusion in sensor networks when cross-correlations are not known and fast computations are desired. The common requirement of sending estimates from one party to another during fusion forfeits local privacy. Current secure fusion algorithms rely on encryption schemes that do not provide sufficient flexibility. As a result, excess communication between estimate producers is required, which is often undesirable. We propose a novel method of homomorphically computing the fast covariance intersection algorithm on estimates encrypted with a combination of encryption schemes. Using order revealing encryption, we show how an approximate solution to the fast covariance intersection weights can be computed and combined with partially homomorphic encryptions of estimates, to calculate an encryption of the fused result. The described approach allows secure fusion of any number of private estimates, making third-party cloud processing a viable option when working with sensitive state estimates or when performing estimation over untrusted networks."

The educational administration is considering increasing the timetable of Physical Education to three hours in all Compulsory Education. However, the lack of agreement among Physical Education teachers may jeopardize in the medium term the situation reached by our area in the last 30 years. This article has two objectives: a) to establish a framework for discussion that will serve to generate debate among teachers regarding the possibility of increasing the number of hours in PE; b) to present a proposal, through the implementation of pedagogical models, formative assessment and high-intensity intervallic training, that will make it possible to respond to the educational need to increase the number of hours. The result of the proposal may serve as a guideline for educational administrations to take the long awaited step of proposing the third hour, without forgetting the importance in relation to other benefits that it provides such as the affective-motivational ones, those of social insertion, the cognitive ones or those of interpersonal relations."

"WOS:000583881400022"	"Yes"	"gold_doaj"	"Emergency management in industrial plants is a fundamental issue to ensure the safety of operators. The emergency management analyses two fundamental aspects: the system reliability and the human reliability. System reliability is the capability of ensuring the functional properties within a variability of work conditions, considering the possible deviations due to unexpected events. However, system reliability is strongly related to the reliability of its weakest component. The complexity of the processes could generate incidental situations and the worker appears (human reliability) to be the weakest part of the whole system. The complexity of systems influences operator's ability to take decisions during emergencies. The aim of the present research is to develop a new approach to evaluate human error probability (HEP), called Systematic Human Reliability Analysis (SHRA). The proposed approach considers internal and external factors that affect operator's ability. The new approach is based on Nuclear Action Reliability Assessment (NARA), Simplified Plant Analysis Risk Human Reliability (SPAR-H) and on the Performance Shaping Factors (PSFs) relationship. The present paper analysed some shortcomings related to literature approaches, especially the limitations of the working time. We estimated HEP, after 8 hours (work standard) during emergency conditions. The correlations between the advantages of these three methodologies allows proposing a HEP analysis during accident scenarios emergencies. SHRA can be used to estimate human reliability during emergencies. SHRA has been applied in a nuclear accident scenario, considering 24 hours of working time. The SHRA results highlight the most important internal and external factors that affect operator's ability."

Yet, according to the literature, Fellini was founder, member or manager of no less than three film production companies. Research based on archival material, however, reveals that Fellini never played the role of producer, nor founded a film production company. Thus, the albeit frail aura of Fellini as entrepreneur falls apart. His name seems to have been used by producers as a brand to foster commercial operations. This process starts with La Dolce Vita (1960), which granted Fellini the status of 'archetypical art film director' and freed him from producer-imposed obligations. Delving into a mass of various, new archival sources and cross-referencing data, this article analyses how the Fellini brand - as auteur versus the film producer's traditional capitalist logic - was constructed and later exploited by Fellini and his producers."

Biochar is a solid carbonized material that demonstrates a number of interesting properties such as high microporosity and surface area, presence of surface functional groups and micro and macroelements. Therefore, it can be applied as a sorbent to remove organic and inorganic substances from liquid and gaseous phases, as an amendment in composting and anaerobic fermentation, a component of fertilizers and soil improver or as a filler in production of biocomposites. The scope of this work included: collection and analysis of poultry manure samples from an organic poultry farm (a), laboratory pyrolysis of poultry manure in selected temperatures (400-700 degrees C) (b), the analysis of biochar properties (chemical composition, surface area, functional groups, etc.) produced at different temperatures (c) and discussion of potential applications for the produced poultry derived biochars (d). The efficiency of conversion of poultry manure to biochar was about 62% for 400 degrees C and about 55% for 700 degrees C. The obtained results demonstrated that biochars produced from poultry manure showed a complex chemical composition. The following elements were present: carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sodium, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, phosphorus, sulphur, chlorine, potassium, calcium, iron. Surface area of the obtained biochars was very low (about 5 m(2)g(-1)). Gradual aromatization of the investigated biochar and the formation of wide range of oxygen functionalities were observed. In view to the obtained results poultry manure derived biochars due to chemical composition could be potentially applied as a component of fertilizers, soil improvers and composts. However, other applications such as removal of various contaminants, e.g., from wastewater or exhaust air would require additional modification through thermal and/or chemical treatment."

Recently, estimating returns to scale and scale elasticity using tools such as data envelopment analysis (DEA) has attracted considerable attention among researchers. The existing approaches to calculate scale elasticity in DEA context, assume all inputs and outputs are real-valued and in this sense, the underlying technology is a continuous set. In many real cases, however, we face input/output measures that are restricted to be integer-valued. Scale properties of frontier points in such cases are interesting and important. In this paper, this problem in integer-valued DEA is studied. The Lagrangian dual formulation of a mixed integer linear programming problem is used to calculate the scale elasticity of a frontier point. To illustrate the real applicability of the theoretical framework, a real case on electricity distribution companies is given."

In such models, the reflectivity of a target or clutter is a realization of a stochastic process with certain autocorrelation properties. While most targets reflect the impinging electromagnetic radiation instantaneously, some targets with complicated geometry and/or material composition may exhibit delayed scattering. Detecting such delays will provide valuable data for target identification. However, the scattering delay can be confused with the signal propagation delay, and this difference is sometimes rather subtle. Due to the stochastic nature of the radar data, the classification errors are inevitable. The misclassification rate depends on the parameters characterizing the radar system, imaging scene, and observation settings. A convolutional neural network is applied to the problem of discrimination between the instantaneous and delayed targets in synthetic aperture radar images. A trained neural network demonstrates the discrimination quality commensurate with that of the benchmark maximum likelihood-based classifier."

The design of asphalt pavements for streets and roads evolved from empiric to mechanistic-empiric (M-E) procedures throughout the 20th century. The mechanistic-empiric method, based on layered elastic theory, became a common practice with the publication of separate procedures by Shell Oil, Asphalt Institute, and French LCPC, among others. Since its origin, the M-E procedure can consider incremental pavement design but, only until the beginning of the 21st century, the computational power became available to practicing engineers. American MEPDG represents the state-of-the-art M-E incremental design procedure with significant advantages and drawbacks, the latter mainly related to the extensive calibration activities required to assure a proper analysis and design according to subgrade, climate, and materials at a particular location and for an intended level of reliability. Perpetual pavements are a subset of M-E designed pavements with a proven history of success for the conditions where they are warranted. No design method, either the most straightforward empirical approach or the most elaborated incremental mechanistic one, is appropriate without proper knowledge about the fundamental design factors and calibration of the performance models for each distress mode upon consideration."

Inspired by this viewpoint, this letter presents a novel formulation for nonlinear control systems that are subject to coupling constraints via virtual coupling inputs that abstractly play the role of Lagrange multipliers. The main contribution of this letter is a process-mirroring solving for Lagrange multipliers in robotic systems-wherein we isolate subsystems free of coupling constraints that provably encode the full-order dynamics of the coupled control system from which it was derived. This dimension reduction is leveraged in the formulation of a nonlinear optimization problem for the isolated subsystem that yields periodic orbits for the full-order coupled system. We consider the application of these ideas to robotic systems, which can be decomposed into subsystems. Specifically, we view a quadruped as a coupled control system consisting of two bipedal robots, wherein applying the framework developed allows for gaits (periodic orbits) to be generated for the individual biped yielding a gait for the full-order quadrupedal dynamics. This is demonstrated on a quadrupedal robot through simulation and walking experiments on rough terrains."	"This work was supported by National Science Foundation under Award IIS 1724464."

"WOS:000544977200016"	""	""	"It is often the case that high quality mathematics education professional development involves enhancing both teachers' content knowledge and their pedagogical skills, specifically for teaching mathematics. However, when teachers are immersed in their own learning of mathematics, they are often unaware of the facilitators' instructional decisions and moves that influence their own learning outcomes, as well as how these might apply to their future teaching. Thus, while the teachers can appreciate their new understanding of content, they may not have added significantly to their understanding of the instructor's pedagogical moves that facilitated their growth. As a result, teachers may leave even high quality professional development without assurance that they will be able to adjust their teaching in ways that support their own students' meaningful learning of mathematics. In this work we describe one way in which professional development can both enhance teachers' subject matter knowledge and help to transform these new understandings into pedagogical content knowledge; the mathematics content sessions provide the platform for reflection on pedagogy. To facilitate this reflection, a record of practice is created by facilitators, and thereafter utilized for participants and facilitators to identify and analyze critical moments in the mathematics content session. This paper offers two specific examples of records of practice and how they were used, as well as teachers' reactions and insights. It also discusses various formats of records of practice, the logistics of developing them, and ends with the potential benefits of using records of practice in professional development for teachers."

A mathematical theory is provided to show the changes that occurs in Gaussian input pulse due to intensity dependent dispersive parameter. Group velocity dispersion (GVD) parameter beta(2) is one of the limiting factors in optical fiber communication. We have studied the effect of intensity on pulse propagation by considering beta(2) as intensity dependent parameter. This is done by incorporating the optical Kerr effect that is considering intensity dependent refractive index in beta(2). Polarization induced in the medium due to incident Gaussian pulse is obtained by using the Bloch equation. The analysis of induced polarization is done by using Non linear Schrodinger equation. The results illustrate that it is possible to control the shape of the pico second pulse by changing the intensity of input pulse. The reason for the change in the pulse behavior is due to the change in GVD parameter. This change in GVD parameter results due to change in the refractive index by considering it as intensity dependent. The aim of this study is to introduce a new theoretical environment that provides the possibility of new optical spectra measurement."

In this study, ZnO-NPs were synthesized using Magnoliae officinalis (MO) aqueous extract as a reducing and capping agent. Characteristics of ZnO-NPs were analyzed using analytical techniques such as UV, FTIR, SEM, XRD, EDX, DLS, and zeta potential. After that, the antibacterial activity of ZnO-NPs against methicilin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was studied. The results of FTIR and UV-vis spectra showed successful biosynthesis of ZnO-NPs, because the absorption peaks and functional groups involved in the synthesis process were well developed. Additionally, the SEM micrograph and the DLS showed that the morphology and size distribution of the ZnO-NPs were spherical with a size of 150 nm. XRD, EDX, and zeta potential indicated crystal form of ZnO-NPs with zinc: oxygen ratio of 72.35:27 and a surface charge of +28 mv. The antibacterial activity of ZnO-NPs with the assessment of the well-diffusion method, MIC and MBC indicated the highest inhibitory effect at a concentration of 300 mu g/ml, MIC 250 mu g/ml and MBC 300 mu g/ml. As regards the desirable antimicrobial activity of biosynthesized ZnO-NPs using MO extract, they may be used for medicinal purposes, in particular as antimicrobials and antiseptic agents."

Therefore, understanding the initiation and evolution of the erupting prominences provides a crucial physical understanding of the CME initiation and evolution, as well its broader impacts on space weather and geospace climate. This review focuses on the PEs and their associated CMEs in five events. Three events represent an eruption of a single prominence/filament flux rope(FR). The other events present interaction and eruption of two nearby FRs of the same prominence. The five events differ from one another by the type, pre-eruption and eruption evolution of PEs and specific properties of the linked CMEs. The magnetic properties of the source region and overlying magnetic arcade as main factors for the specific physical linkage between PE and CME are discussed for the five events."

Qualitative analysis of semistructured in-depth interviews with the participants identified two dimensions in the teachers' narratives: the style of DGBL adoption (traditional/innovative), and the extent of DGBL implementation (high/medium/low). Based on these dimensions, four types of teachers were defined: the innovator and trailblazer, the implementer, the effort maker, and the struggler. The research findings can serve as an essential tool to help managers and decision-makers design professional development programs and tailor DGBL use to the four types of teachers identified in the study.

These members share the responsibility in their learning. This methodology is increasingly prevalent in pre-school education and primary and secondary education in Balearic Islands. For that reason, the present study was developed from the implementation of a teaching experience throughout cooperative learning in the subject of Physical Education during the second year of the primary education degree in the Department of Pedagogy and specific Didactics at the University of the Balearic Islands. The aim is to determine pupils' degree of acceptance of the Physical Education subject based on cooperative learning. An important highlight lays in the use of practice logs as a main tool used for the development of the subject. Very satisfactory and promising results are shown regarding the assessment of the subject through cooperative learning in variables such as satisfaction, performance, students' involvement and teacher evaluation, with a score higher than 8 over 10. According to the present results, students' positive acceptance of the cooperative learning methodology in the primary education degree is confirmed. We propose to include cooperative learning also as a content of the subject, apart from as a learning methodology."

"WOS:000535804800003"	"Yes"	"gold_doaj"	"yyyy Airborne laser scanning has been a valuable tool for forestry applications since it began to be used commercially. Thanks to the high 3D resolution provided by the Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point cloud, it has provided great convenience in complex 3D modeling processes needed for forestry applications such as forest inventory, forest management, determination of carbon stocks and the characterization of biodiversity. LiDAR data provides a new dimension in forestry applications with its high 3D resolution and multiple return characteristics. The extraction of woodland areas from the LiDAR point cloud has great importance for automating the determination of tree heights, species and stand frequency which will be used for generating canopy height models (CHM). In this study, woodland areas in the urban scene were automatically extracted by using the multiple return properties of the LiDAR point cloud. The proposed approach consists of three major steps namely pre-processing, parameter calculation and k-d tree search for trees which were implemented in MATLAB. In the first step, multiple return points have been identified from the LiDAR point cloud, which will be then used to determine possible tree locations. Then, by using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, neighborhood relations among the multi return points which were extracted from the initial point cloud data, were formed and a rule-based filter was applied by taking advantage of neighborhood relations. In addition, the initial point cloud was filtered with the Cloth Simulation Filtering (CSF) algorithm to separate ground and non-ground points where non-ground points used to extract trees. In the second step, non-vegetation points were removed by applying a threshold based on the change of curvature and planarity parameters, which are derived from the filtered non-ground point cloud. In the last step, in order to extract trees, a k-d tree structure was created from the filtered non-ground points to find nearest neighbors of each multi return point within a given diameter in the k-d tree structure. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the approach, the extracted boundaries were compared with the manually digitized woodland boundaries from the true orthophoto of the study area using correctness, completeness and quality metrics."

Machine learning technique with feature-selection contributes greatly to the detecting of cancer, because an efficient feature-selection method can remove redundant features. In this paper, a Fuzzy Preference-Based Rough Set (FPRS) blended with Support Vector Machine (SVM) has been applied in order to predict cancer biomarkers for biological and gene expression datasets. Biomarkers are determined by deploying three models of FPRS, namely, Fuzzy Upward Consistency (FUC), Fuzzy Downward Consistency (FLC), and Fuzzy Global Consistency (FGC). The efficiency of the three models with SVM on five datasets is exhibited, and the biomarkers that have been identified from FUC models have been reported."

When bisimulation non-interference is considered, the security objective is not only to avoid the detection of high-level event occurrences, but also to avoid the detection of their non occurrences; i.e., the secret includes also the non occurrences of some events. This letter deals with such a more restrictive security property in the framework of discrete event systems modelled as Petri nets. A necessary and sufficient condition is given to assess bisimulation non-interference in bounded Petri nets. Such a condition requires the solution of integer linear programming optimization problems, whose solution can be used also to statically enforce bisimulation non-interference when this condition is not satisfied by the original system."

They are great ways of biopsychosocial, ethical and aesthetic development of children and adolescents, and their practitioners report higher levels of prosocial behavior among peers. This condition is all the more beneficial the higher the practitioner's degree (length of practice), mode of participation in the AM&DC (practitioner or competitor), the professional qualification of coaches, characteristics of places of practice, the typology of martial arts or even the style (traditional or modem)."

From the perspective of socio-demographic characteristics, this study employs quantile regression for count data to investigate generational differences in household car ownership in Taiwan. The results show that the socio-demographic characteristics affected household car ownership. Due to the seniority effects, households in the later life-cycle stages and households with a higher proportion of elderly members would reduce car demand. But, households with the middle-aged heads owned more cars due to their better economic ability. The income effects are greater for higher income households. Household car ownership varied across generations, which was related to the income effects, the life course, and household structure. Hence, the demographic changes and generational differences in travel preferences should be considered in urban transportation planning. Seamless transportation and senior-friendly facilities would be important for transportation demand management."

In an attempt to achieve the objective of the study, data of 21 sampled non-financial firms were obtained from their annual financial reports from 2010 to 2019 using stratified sampling technique. Data for the sampled companies were analyzed using logit regression analysis. The results of the study provide evidence for significant positive influence of board independence and gender diversity on audit firm choice while board size was found to exert positive but no significant effect on audit firm choice. As to board meeting, findings shows its insignificant negative influence on audit firm choice. Firm size as a control variable shows significant positive influence on the choice of external audit firm. The findings point to the fact that the independence of directors, gender diversity and firm size are the factors that significantly determine firms' choice of external auditor. This implies that as board independence, gender diversity and firm size increase, there is high tendency for the choice of big4 audit firm. Arising from this, the study recommends that board of directors should be dominated by directors with adequate level of financial literacy that will enable proper appreciation of audit quality. Firm should also seek to know whether the qualities of big 4 audit firms always surpass that of their non-big 4 counterparts."

The analysis was carried out in 2017 in accordance with the requirements of the national legislation for monitoring landfills and priority pollutants. The samples of groundwater from the landfill were taken from 25 observation wells, from depths of 45-60 m. The status and dynamics of changes in the landfill groundwater quality were estimated according to the data from the groundwater observation wells of the city observation network with regard to the chemical composition of groundwater and national standards of groundwater quality. The forecast estimates of a low level of pollutants entering groundwater through the soils characterized by low filtration properties were not justified. The concentration of heavy metals in groundwater was within the following range: Fe > Mn > Zn > Al > Cu > Ni > Pb > Cd > Hg. The excess concentration of the nitrogen-containing pollutants was observed within the range from 1.5 to 76 (on average 10 times) above the background value. The organic contamination of landfill groundwater (COD) is 2-9 times and BOD5 - 1.5-3 times higher than the average background value of groundwater observation wells in the city network. The probable cause for the pollutants entry into groundwater is associated with lithogenous and exogenous fracturing of the rocks and insufficient efficiency of the existing anti-filtration system of the landfill."

It allows to check stability under the presence of different packetized network transmission policies where, e.g., newer packets may arrive at the same time or before older packets. The criterion is based on the small gain theorem and explicitly takes into account a packet selection and hold mechanism at the receiver side. It can easily be checked in frequency domain and does not involve any computationally expensive optimization algorithms."

These algorithms address the problem of matching flexible loads with renewable generation, with the objective of maximizing social welfare of the exchange in the system. More specifically, two online matching algorithms are proposed for two generation-load scenarios: (i) when the mean of renewable generation is greater than the mean of the flexible load, and (ii) when the condition (i) is reversed. With the intuition that the performance of such algorithms degrades with increasing randomness of the supply and demand, two properties are proposed for assessing the performance of the algorithms. First property is convergence to optimality (CO) as the underlying randomness of renewable generation and customer loads goes to zero. The second property is deviation from optimality, which is measured as a function of the standard deviation of the underlying randomness of renewable generation and customer loads. The algorithm proposed for the first scenario is shown to satisfy CO and a deviation from optimality that varies linearly with the variation in the standard deviation. We then show that the algorithm proposed for the second scenario satisfies CO and a deviation from optimality that varies linearly with the variation in standard deviation plus an offset under certain condition."

There is a too shortage of available water sources; thus, one option for increasing existing resources is the treatment and reuse of wastewaters. Vinasse poses a long-term risk to public health because of its toxic nature and a huge amount. This study investigates a new prospect of a combination of persulfate (PS)/ peroxymonosulfate (PMS) (activated by Ion (II)) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for reducing total organic carbon (TOC) from vinasse and reuse of treated vinasse as well. Behaviors of PS/Fe(II)/ H2O2 and PMS/ Fe(II)/ H2O2 on total organic carbon (TOC) removal are explored by evaluating various effects, including H2O2 dosage, Fe (II) dosage, pH and reaction time. Hydrogen peroxide was used as an oxidation agent to improve the degradation of the organic matter of vinasse. The addition of H2O2 to PS/ Fe (II) or PMS/ Fe (II) generates highly oxidizing radicals, which enhanced, significantly, the removal of TOC. Both of PS/ Fe (II)/ H2O2 and PMS/ Fe (II)/ H2O2 systems favored neutral pH in removing the organic matter, and they were very active in the first 5 minutes. At the optimum conditions, about 86 % and 83% of TOC removal were achieved by PS/ Fe (II)/ H2O2 and PMS/ Fe (II)/ H2O2, respectively. Therefore, a combination of PS/PMS activated by Fe (II) with H2O2 can be considered as a capable technique for sugarcane vinasse treatment and allowing to reuse the effluents in many applications."

On the other hand, the pedagogical activity is mainly directed to more practical purposes, although not less important, and takes advantage of the knowledge revealed by the different referents of philosophy. However, it has been pointed out that for different reasons education has strayed far from the deeper world of ideas, which can lead to very superficial pedagogical activity. This essay aims to bring philosophy closer to education and, specifically, to physical education. First, the objective was to analyze the meaning of love proposed by two philosophers associated with the phenomenological school, Max Scheler and Jose Ortega y Gasset. Later, that meaning was associated with ethical training in school physical education. The analysis reflects that both agree that love is an objective feeling and an intentional act aimed at adequately preserving what is positively valued. They also recognize that love precedes emotions, thoughts, and desires, as well as its direction goes from the top to the bottom. knowledge can be applied in physical education in different ways, highlighting awareness on the relationship between emotions and ethical values, such as solidarity, respect for human rights, tolerance, and humility."

The field observation data were retrieved by using a conventional method and processed using spectrometric analysis. This study covers the coastal and near land areas which have different levels of anthropogenic activity. The results showed that the coastal waters of Semarang with a high level of anthropogenic activity persistently show a concentration of chlorophyll a (chl-a) twice as large as Jepara coastal waters. This comparison value is obtained based on imagery and field data. Meanwhile, the ratio of chl-a field data in each region shows a value of +/- 5 times greater than the MODIS data. Field observation data shows a higher value than the MODIS-Aqua imagery data. The use of imagery data can be employed as a method of monitoring the eutrophication process on the coast. On the basis of the chlorophyll a classification and field observations, the coastal water of Semarang are classified as eutropic waters and Jepara is categorized as mesotropic category. The classification results will be different if monitoring is carried out using the image data with a location far from the mainland, the Semarang waters are included in the mesotropic category (> 2 mg.m(-3)) and Jepara is included in the oligotropic water category (< 2 mg.m(-3))."

This letter develops an impending battery terminal voltage collapse detection system using a universal adaptive stabilizer (UAS) and a well-known trend filter. This eliminates requiring knowledge of battery model parameter values, or initial state-of-charge (SOC). The proposed approach overcomes the need for extensive training when compared to using neural-networks based techniques. Also, the developed trend filter when used with a UAS, eliminates the need for selecting windows of data to be processed. This is advantageous compared to earlier work, which uses a different trend filtering mechanism, because selection of window sizes is not straightforward. Further, the approach used in this letter shows that the UAS based technique is implementable on a cell phone. Associated mathematical results, and experimental data from such an implementation are presented. Additionally, the technique is also applied to other larger capacity Li-ion batteries showing its versatility.

The Ping Pong Bi-Bi model showed better congruence with the experimental data for all the effects evaluated. The kinetic constants showed that the lipase had an identical affinity, with a value of 0.81 for both substrates and inhibitory constant (Ki) of ascorbic acid (1.959) much higher than oleic acid (0.0008). It has been demonstrated that lipase has good operational stability (14th cycle). The results obtained with the new immobilized enzyme are valuable to elucidate the reaction mechanism. In addition, it represents an important contribution to optimize the reaction and create strategies to increase the productivity of the esters of vitamin C."

NO has effects such as reduction in arterial pressure, anti-inflammatory effects, enhancement of mitochondrial efficiency, and regulation of muscle contractility. Different studies have reported that BJ supplementation has an ergogenic effect in modalities of cardiorespiratory endurance and explosive and intermittent high intensity efforts. Nevertheless, no review has assessed the effect of BJ supplementation on muscle strength production. Thus, the objective of this systematic review is to analyse the effect of BJ supplementation on muscle strength performance. The search using keywords and Boolean connectors was carried out in the databases Dialnet, Directory of Open Access Journals, Medline, Pubmed, Scielo, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus. The search strategy used was the following: (nitrate OR beet *) AND (concept 2) (supplement * OR nutr * OR diet *) AND (concept 3) (strength OR resistance exercise OR resistance training OR muscular power). After the application of the inclusion criteria, a total of 14 articles were selected for review. The review has shown how BJ supplementation can have an ergogenic effect on the production of muscle strength under electrical stimulation, as well as on the production of power over isokinetic contractions only at high angular speeds, the explanatory mechanism being a potentiation of the contractile capacity specifically in type II muscle fibers."

In this work, we continue to identify the potential distributions of the physical characteristics of Jupiter's irregular moons. By using nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, we verified more than 20 commonly used distributions and found that surprisingly, almost all the physical characteristics (i.e., the equatorial radius, equatorial circumference, circumference, volume, mass, surface gravity and escape velocity) of the moons in the Ananke and Carme groups follow log-logistic distributions. Additionally, more than half of the physical characteristics of the moons in the Pasiphae group are theoretically subject to this type of distribution. The discovery of an increasing number of .Jupiter's irregular moons combined with strict analytical derivations, it is increasingly clear and possible to anticipate that the physical characteristics of most irregular moons follow log-logistic distributions."

The research on the development of the D8 country's economy is still minimal, so this research expected to be able to contribute to drafting policies for D8 member countries. By using panel regression, this research finds that there is no impact between export on economic growth. However, political stability had an impact on economic growth in developing-8 countries.

In this paper, we review some relevant and interesting works related to this topic of advanced technologies. We have utilized an analytical review method and have carried out the selection of didactic experiences around four categories which we have considered of relevance: computation (robotics, computational thinking and artificial intelligence), extended reality (augmented reality and virtual reality), games (video games, serious games) and educational tools (LMS, apps). With these descriptors, we have searched educational experiences that can serve as examples of good educational practices with advanced technologies. The references, which we collect, may be of interest and use to researchers or to educational professionals who are searching specific information on these topics. The main conclusion we reach is that the bibliography is extensive, and this shows the interest that these themes generate within the scientific field.

An international consensus on legal, institutional, and technical aspects of a 3D cadastre solution seems difficult. Since rights, restrictions, and responsibilities with a 3D component are somehow registered administratively, stakeholders from the legal domain are reluctant to 3D cadastre. From a technical point of view, the technology required to use 3D digital data for registration has matured sufficiently in the past twenty years.

Material and Methods: This was an ecological study using secondary data from the National Epidemiological Oral Health Survey 2010 and from the United Nations Development Program. Human development was measured by the Human Development Index (HDI) and dental caries by the Decayed, Missing and Filled Teeth index (DMFT). Dental caries prevalence and experience at the age of 12, and state HDI were entered into Google Sheets (R) and Google My Maps (R) for map creation. Data were analyzed by Pearson's correlation (HDI and DMFT, DMFT individual components, prevalence of dental caries and prevalence of dental pain) (p<0.05). Results: Prevalence of dental caries ranged from 37.3% to 78.2% among the states. Dental caries was more prevalent in Rondonia (78.2%) and less prevalent in Santa Catarina (37.3%). Mean DMFT ranged from 1.06 to 4.81, with the highest value in Rondonia (4.81) and the lowest in Distrito Federal (1.06). HDI ranged from 0.631 (Alagoas) to 0.863 (Distrito Federal). There were negative correlations between HDI and dental caries (r=-0.504), dental caries experience (r=-0.459), decayed (r=-0.441) and missing (r=-0.441) components of the DMFT (p<0.05). Conclusion: Higher human development of the region lower dental caries experience and prevalence in 12-year-old Brazilian schoolchildren."

This study explores how salespeople use social networking sites (SNSs) to improve their selling performance. Accordingly, the authors examine the mediating role of adaptive selling behavior on SNSs and consider the relation between performance and service leadership. In this study, 422 salespeople are brought in direct contact with customers in Taiwan, and it is found that SNS infusion and service leadership are crucial to salespeople's adaptive selling behavior. The results provide strong evidence for the mediating effect of adaptive selling behavior on the relation between each antecedent and SNS infusion."

One such fundamental reaction of organometallic chemistry is transmetalation, a general term that in its modern meaning describes the transfer of carbon ligands (i.e., alkyl, aryl, alkynyl, allyl, etc.) from one metal to another. Transmetalation has a very long history and the reaction dates back to the early beginnings of organometallic chemistry with the work of the English chemist Edward Frankland (1825-1899) in the 1860s. Since its introduction, transmetalation has found significant utility in synthetic chemistry, allowing the generation of a wide variety of organometallic compounds of both main group and transition metal elements, and has been identified as a critical step in many synthetic organic reactions catalyzed by transition metal complexes. Regardless of the long history of this reaction and its significant applications, transmetalation is not covered in the same depth as other fundamental reactions in organometallic chemistry and is rarely given serious treatment in organometallic textbooks. Thus, the aim of the current work is to supplement current textbooks by presenting the basics of what is currently known about the details and parameters of this important reaction."

The case of telecommunications sector of Malawi was analysed using secondary data comprise policy documents and media reports. The results showed that power relations affected the autonomy of the telecommunications regulator in performing its functions. The effects of power dynamics created practices and conduct of stakeholders that contributed towards the barriers in market entry of mobile network operators in the telecommunications sector. Consequently, there was limited market competition and the cost of ICT services remained high. Power relations were also productive in enabling stakeholders to raise sector problems to the regulator. The study provides an understanding of power relations in the regulation of telecommunications in the context of an African country."

The evolution of macroscopically localized plastic strain at various stages of strain hardening is visualized via a Digital image speckle correlation (DISC) method. The processing of stress-strain curves of the steel samples enabled one to distinguish the following stages of strain hardening: the yield point, the parabolic hardening, and the pre-failure.The inspection of local strain distributions reveals that the parabolic work hardening is presented by a system of stationary plastic strain centers placed at equal distances. To perform a comprehensive analysis of local elongations from the parabolic work hardening toward the pre-failure stage, the total elongation components were measured at the strain centers. The average total elongation is found to be almost constant at the parabolic work hardening, but abruptly increases when approaching the pre-failure stage. The plastic strain instability is highlighted, as well, by the rising total elongation (amplitude) at the strain sites."

The offline problem that computes the constraint sets explicitly ensures that the feasible regions of the MPC controllers are non-empty, and whenever the controllers are feasible, the overall system constraints are satisfied with the least conservativeness possible.

This letter proves that there exist a special class of passivity based controllers which coincide with sliding mode ones. This approach enables us to obtain sliding mode control systems with explicit energy based Lyapunov functions. The proposed approach requires a kind of matching condition under which the two control schemes coincide with each other. How to relax the condition is also discussed.

These opportunistic pathogens can produce biofilm on non-biological surfaces, such as removable orthodontic appliances. Over the past two decades, there has been a significant increase in resistance to several types of antifungal drugs. Recently, there is a growing interest in using herbal plants and their extracts as an alternative to antifungal drugs. A common plant is basil, which belongs to Lamiaceae family. This study aimed to determine the effect of basil extracts on the adhesion of C. albicans and C. dubliniensis to acrylic surfaces of removable orthodontic appliances. Basil dried leaves were macerated in ethanol to extract its constituent, and then the extract was dissolved in water and fractioned by other solvents, including n-hexane and ethyl acetate, successively. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the extracts against standard species of Candida were determined by the broth microdilution method based on clinical and laboratory standard institute (CLSI) protocol. Afterward, adherence and biofilm formation tests were done on acrylic specimens in the vicinity of proper concentration of fractions with the help of the Crystal Violet and spectrophotometry method. MIC for ethyl acetate fraction, n-hexane fraction, ethanol crude extract, and the aqueous fraction was 1024, 2048, =2048, >2048 mu g/ml, respectively. Inhibition of adherence and biofilm formation for Candida albicans and Candida dubliniensis in the vicinity of ethyl acetate fraction was 73% and 78%, respectively. In the vicinity of n-hexane fraction was 65% and 78%, respectively. Two fractions could inhibit the growth, adherence, and biofilm formation of two Candida species."

However, it is necessary to know the differences in the number of hours scheduled. Objective: To determine the influence that the allocation of two or four hours of Physical Education per week has on body composition, physical condition, and level of physical activity in schoolchildren. Method: a total of 244 students of 13.11 +/- .84 years of age were evaluated. Anthropometric variables, physical condition, and level of physical activity were measured during Physical Education classes. Results: Significant differences were found for body composition (weight p = .0367), physical condition (VO2max p<.0001, dynamometry p=.0165) and level of physical activity (p<.0001). Based on gender, significant differences between boys and girls were detected in the physical fitness variables (VO2max p<.0001, horizontal jump p<.0001, and dynamometry p<.0002) and in time in sedentary (p=.0403) and light physical activity (p<.0001). Conclusion: Weight, VO2max, and levels of moderate and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity are positively modified when performing four hours. In addition, it is concluded that boys are more physically active than girls and have a better physical condition. Boys and girls with higher BMI and BMIZ-score values have lower physical condition."

Different from existing works that either focus on spontaneous synchronization, assume linear dynamics or rely on dynamics cancellation, here we provide a constructive method to prove pinning controllability towards the desired trajectory selected by the pinner. We introduce an algorithmic procedure that associates to any connected topology a suitable Lyapunov function for the network system. The approach is demonstrated on an illustrative example."

"WOS:000577181000001"	"Yes"	"gold_doaj"	"Bench press exercise is one of the most popular exercises in sports science. It has been studied from different approaches, mostly analyzing the effects of technical variations in order to improve training schedule on different sports and populations. The one repetition maximum has been used as a reference to quantify the load in diverse studies. However, knowing how to adjust training intensities is necessary in order to schedule training accurately. The objective of the present study was to analyze the response of kinematic, kinetic and psychological variables at different percentages of 1RM. The study sample was comprised of thirty healthy university students (Age 23 +/- 0.45 years; height 181.13 +/- 2.25 cm; weight 78.25 +/- 4.81 Kg; muscle percentage 52.10 +/- 0.30%, fat percentage 12.05 +/- 0.59%; BMI 24, 12 +/- 0.84). The participants attended a familiarization session with the bench press technique and performed an incremental test to obtain the 1RM. They returned to carry out the same protocol seven days after, but different intensities of the 1RM were accomplished (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%). The results obtained provided descriptive data about the behaviour of the analyzed variables by increasing the load on trained subjects. The present research could suggest variations in the expected workloads and predict possible adaptations within the force work schedule."

First-grade secondary school students were selected from two schools in Puerto Maldonado city, public and private. The design of the study was quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest evaluations and a control group. Each group had between 18-30 students, and the experimental group was given chess classes twice a week for three months. To analyze the effect of the intervention a Generalized Linear Model was used. In the two abilities evaluated, the posttest results of the experimental group were higher than the control group. A significant effect of the application of sports chess was found in the development of abilities in mathematical reasoning, attention, and concentration (P < 0.001). In the public school, the effect of the program on mathematical reasoning was higher in boys than in girls (P < 0.05). Our results provide relevant information for schools to develop strategies to promote chess as a teaching strategy. We concluded that the implementation of a chess program influences the development of the intellectual abilities in school-aged children of Peruvian Amazon."

However, its distribution and potential growing regions of cherimoya are not defined for Mexico. That is why, this research aims to map the natural distribution of cherimoya and different eco-climatic regions where it is grown in Mexico as well as to map the climatic adaptability with the current climate and a prospection with the climate change scenario, all by different models of GIS. The general distribution model of cherimoya in Mexico showed that it had a chance to find cherimoya in a natural way in the biogeographic provinces Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, Sierra Madre del Sur and Highlands of Chiapas. Three eco-climatic groups were found in the distribution of cherimoya that corresponded to climates C(m)(w), (A)C(e'), and (A)C(e), respectively. Where the group with climate (A)C(e) had the most restricted distribution. The potential growing regions of excellent adaptation of cherimoya were found in the biogeographic provinces of Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, Sierra Madre Occidental, Sierra Madre Oriental, Sierra Madre del Sur and Highlands of Chiapas. Finally, based on eco-crop modelling, it is concluded that climate change will not greatly affect areas of excellent adaptation of cherimoya in Mexico."

In this work, we report phase diagrams of simple models of colloidal nanocrystals confined at a flat interface. By performing extensive computer simulations we elucidate the mesoscale organization that takes place as different parameters are varied. Our simulation results uncover rich phase diagrams where hexagonal, rhomboid, honeycomb and stripe phases as well as hierarchical self-assembly are found. Our results could serve as a guideline for experimentalists to design colloidal nanocrystal arrangements to target specific applications."
