ZIF-8 has been widely conjugated with bio-entities offering remarkable loading capacity, high chemical stability in physiological environments, and tunable drug release properties. There are several methods to encapsulate biological species into ZIF-8. The synthesis methods such as one-pot synthesis and postsynthetic modification are widely used for the conjugation of biological species and ZIF-8. The biointerface interactions between the biomolecules and ZIF-8 precursors enhanced the synthesis procedure and improved the yield and the properties of the final products. Two enzymes and hybrid conjugation of enzyme and a nanoparticle were also reported. These combinations offered dual functions and provided extra properties such as simple separation of the materials after uses. A brief discussion of the applications of ZIF-8 biocomposite was also covered. This review allowed the readers to acquire insights into the importance of ZIF-8 for the immobilization of biomolecules for biomedicine."

"WOS:000570974900098"	"Yes"	"bronze"	"The potential of agricultural waste materials for the removal of synthetic dye, Phenol Red (PR) and Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) from aqueous solution was investigated. One of the major pollutants of water pollution, dyes, which not only result in enormous damage to the water body but also impact the organism's health, as it is highly toxic and carcinogenic by nature. Agricultural wastes are sustainable adsorbents since they are availability and low cost, which can also replace the traditional activated carbon. Therefore, this study investigated the removal of PR and RBBR from dye solution by adsorption onto the treated adsorbent. Two best out of ten adsorbents were chosen through a screening process using RBBR as a tested dye. Coconut shells (Cocos nucifera) and ambarella peels (Spondias dulcis) were selected as the main adsorbent of this study since they achieved the highest removal rate compared to others. With the selected adsorbent, the experiment was continued to study the effect of different initial dye concentration, adsorbent dosage, contact time, pH, and particle size on dye adsorption. Results show that different parameters can affect the removal rate and adsorption capacity of adsorbent in a different way. The adsorption of dye from aqueous solution onto adsorbent was evaluated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to investigate the functional groups of adsorbent before and after the adsorption process, and it found that the functional group would affect the effectiveness or removal rate and adsorption capacity of adsorbents. The present study indicates that 99.82% of PR with an adsorption capacity of 1.05 mg/g can be removed by 5-gram ambarella peels. While coconut shells had removed 75.78% of RBBR with an adsorption capacity of 7.96 mg/g for 21 hours. The results proved that these agricultural waste were promising materials as an alternative adsorbent for the removal of dye from aqueous solution."

"WOS:000570975300035"	"Yes"	"bronze"	": Initially, the use of Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology is mainly for the production of prototypes of a new invention and design. However, the AM technology had extended to the tooling industry, medical scaffolding, and direct part production. This is due to the extensive research and development carried out around the globe regardless of the material, equipment, and technology of AM. In this study, characterization and properties of PCL/PLA/PEG/Nano-HA polymer composites were investigated. Polycaprolactone (PCL), polylactic acid (PLA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), and nanohydroxyapatite (n-HA) composites were prepared by melting and compounding the mixture using a Brabender machine. The composition of the materials was determined by previous research that it is the optimum recipe, with the ratio of PCL:PLA is 7:3 while the composition of PEG and nano-HA is 5% per hundred resin each. The temperature of the Brabender machine was set at 160 degrees C, and the speed of the mixer was set at 30 rpm. After the mixing, the composites were characterized by using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to determine the spectrum and quality of the composite mixed. Based on the spectrum, it can be verified that the characteristic of n-HA powder had been incorporated well into the PCL/PLA/PEG polymer blend. The thermal properties of the composites were investigated by using Thermogravimetry Analyzer (TGA). The results showed that the addition of n-HA lowered the initial degradation temperature and peak degradation temperature. Apparently, the addition of nHA did not increase the degradation temperature of the composites. Furthermore, Simulated Body Fluid (SBF) test was carried out to access the bioactivity properties of the composites after the addition of nHA. The results had proved that the addition of n-HA had triggered the growth of apatite layer on the surface of the samples treated with SBF. The growth of the apatite layer was verified by the X-ray Diffraction pattern, and the results proved the initial assumptions."

The proposed methodology considers a dynamic controller such that the relationship between the control input and the error signal of interest can be expressed in terms of a transfer function. Accordingly, the control gains can be tuned through a frequency analysis approach. Additionally, two practical advantages of the resulting controllers are that they do not require velocity measurements, and they can cope with input saturation. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology through the stabilization of a planar manipulator, where the experimental results corroborate the effectiveness of the technique."

"WOS:000549258800009"	""	""	"This letter proposes an adaptive neural network-based backstepping controller that uses rigid graph theory to address the distance-based formation control problem and target tracking for nonlinear multi-agent systems with bounded time-delay and disturbance. The radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is used to overcome and compensate for the unknown nonlinearity and disturbance in the system dynamics. The effect of the state time-delay of the agents is alleviated by using an appropriate control signal that is designed based on specific Lyapunov function and Young's inequality. The adaptive neural network (NN) weights tuning law is derived using this Lyapunov function. An upper bound for the singular value of the normalized rigidity matrix is introduced, and uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the formation distance error is rigorously proven based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method are validated through the simulation results on nonlinear multi-agent systems. Comparisons between the proposed distance-based method and an existing, displacement-based method are provided to evaluate the performance of the suggested method."

The analysis and review of the current state of development of fiber-optic conductors is performed. The problems of occurrence of microcracks in the body of optical fibers during mechanical loading during operation are considered. In the process of winding optical fibers and further operation, cracks occur. The conducted research allows us to solve an important production problem related to increasing the strength of optical fibers and reducing the number of microcracks. The object of scientific research is quartz optical fiber of the G652 standard, used for the production of fiber-optic cables. For optical fibers, the greatest danger is the stretching, which is observed when rewinding the fiber, during its cabling, during the laying and operation of the optical cable. It was found that the mechanical tensile strength of G652 optical fiber was from 4482 to 4 808 MPa, and the number of cracks and their parameters affect the tensile strength of the fiber."

In this study, BZ in situ gel nanoemulsions (NEs) were developed and evaluated for transcorneal permeation via the bovine corneal membrane. The spontaneous emulsification method was employed to prepare BZ in situ gel NEs. Various physicochemical characteristics, including particle size, polydispersity index, pH, refractive index, and viscosity, were evaluated. Accelerated physical stability and in vitro drug release, as well as transcorneal permeation studies was performed by applying the Franz-type diffusion cells. Thermosensitive BZ in situ gel NEs with desired physicochemical features and sustained release profiles were designed in the current study. Optimized Formulations exhibited physical stability under different conditions. The transcorneal permeation of formulations was higher than that of suspension, especially for F3b formulation. According to the present in vitro and ex vivo evaluations, it is concluded that in situ gel NEs could be a topical administration of BZ as a suitable ocular drug delivery system."

"WOS:000569565600001"	"Yes"	"bronze"	"We present a framework for generalizing the primal-dual gradient method, also known as the gradient descent ascent method, for solving convex-concave minimax problems. The framework is based on the observation that the primal-dual gradient method can be viewed as an inexact gradient method applied to the primal problem. Unlike the setting of traditional inexact gradient methods, the inexact gradient is computed by a dynamic inexact oracle, which is a discrete-time dynamical system whose output asymptotically approaches the exact gradient. For minimax problems, dynamic inexact oracles are capable of modeling a range of first-order methods for computing the gradient of the primal objective, which relies on solving the inner maximization problem. We provide a unified convergence analysis of gradient methods with dynamic inexact oracles and demonstrate its use in creating new accelerated primal-dual algorithms."

This study presents the treatment course of a 25-year-old man undergone a previous improper orthodontic treatment with unnecessary extraction of the upper and lower right first premolar teeth leading to asymmetric dental arches. The patient complained of dental crowding, an unaesthetic smile arch, and the maxillary and mandibular dental midline deviation. The proposed treatment plan goals were decrowding and correction of both arches asymmetry and achievement of coincident upper and lower dental midlines. The corrective treatment plan consisted of total arch mesialzation in both dental arches using an innovative TAD assisted jig. The overall treatment was accomplished in 28 months with significant improvement in facial aesthetic and reasonable periodontal status. This innovative clinical biomechanical setup of miniscrew-anchored sliding jig helped us achieve all the treatment goals (total dental arches mesialization, dental midline deviation correction, and ideal final aesthetic and occlusion) in a reasonable period of time. With proper planning, innovative designs based on TADs are effective alternatives in challenging cases such as uni or bilateral dental arches mesialization, and dental asymmetry correction."

The data was obtained in March 2007 and October 2012 during monitoring with the Zeiss 2000 telescope at the Observatory at Peak Terskol. These observations revealed the presence of small scale high-frequency oscillations (HFO) in a calm state of a star, previously discovered during outbursts by Zhilyaev et al. (2000), and then confirmed by Contadakis et al. (2004). The amplitude-frequency characteristics of HFO are discussed. To search for periodicities in the calm state, we used the Fourier transform to clean the harmonic with a high signal-to-noise ratio on the star's light curve. After the cleaning procedures, we can see small-scale HFO, which exceed instrumental errors. We found periodic pilot signals on YZ CMi, which control the flares of a star. Their amplitude is small, several hundredths of a magnitude in U-rays. We demonstrate that both large and small flares appear at the highs of the pilot signals. Thus, we conclude that a star flare activity is not random, but a certain deterministic process. This effect is a new phenomenon that is not taken into account in modern theories of stellar flares."

Education has been one of the most affected due to the administrative imposition of the total closure of educational centres in most of the countries of the world. The modality of distance education, fundamentally in digital support, was able to offer emergency solutions to this crisis. In this paper, a reflection is carried out on the prior perceptions to COVID-19, related to this educational modality. Subsequently, ideas are provided on the way in which the educational response to confinement was mainly undertaken, through remote emergency education that considerably deviated from what was appropriate in designs and developments of quality distance education. Many mistakes were made and, therefore, there were too many negative perceptions from many students, families and teachers, quite a few of the latter, previously reluctant to these latest formats. Finally, the article addresses the most recent problem, related to post-confinement times, in which it is not foreseen that every student can go to physical classrooms in face-to-face centres in the same space and time. Suggestions are offered on how to address this problem, through hybridization solutions, mixed teaching and learning, combined or, better, integrated and flexible."

Methods: 11 healthy male professional soccer players, randomly performed three modalities of isometric squat at a 60 degrees knee flexion: conventional squat (SQ), squat with hip abduction contraction (SQ-ABD) and squat with hip adduction contraction (SQ-ADD), controlled at 70% of 1 maximum repetition. The activity of the gluteus medius (GM), tensor fasciae latae (TFL), vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), semitendinosus (ST) and biceps femoris (BF) was obtained through surface electromyography. Hip (GM/TFL), quadriceps (VM/VL) hamstrings (ST/BF), and hamstrings/quadriceps (H/Q) ratios were analyzed. Results: GM increases in SQ-ABD and SQ-ADD compared to SQ (p<.01). The TFL, VL, SM and BF muscles have significantly higher activity in SQ-ADD compared to SQ (p<.05). The VL, VM and BF muscles significantly increase their activity in SQ-ADD compared to SQ-ABD (p <0.05). GM/TFL, VM/VL and ST/BF do not show significant differences between the three isometric squat methods. The H/Q ratio was higher in SQ-ABD and SQ-ADD compared to SQ (p<.01). Conclusion: The squat with hip adduction contraction in a controlled manner increases the muscular activity of the hip and thigh. Performing this combined maneuver can have benefits in sports training and rehabilitation because it increases the H/Q ratio of soccer players."

Thus, interactions that an individual has with other individuals, to some extent, influence the decisions they make. There have been many efforts to uncover, explore, and measure the concept of social influence. Thus, modeling influence is an open and challenging problem where most evaluation models focus on online social networks. However, they fail to characterize some properties of social influence. To address the limitations of the previous approaches, we propose a novel Probabilistic Reasoning system for social INfluence analysis (PRIN) to examine the social influence process and elucidate the factors that affect it in an attempt to explain this phenomenon. In this paper, we present a model that quantitatively measures social influence in online social networks. Experiments on a real social network such as Twitter demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms traditional feature engineering-based approaches. This suggests the effectiveness of this novel model when modeling and predicting social influence."	"The authors would like to thank CONACYT for the financial support."

Ten reinforced concrete beams with a cross section. 90 mm wide, 150 mm depth and a length of 1000 mm were designed and tested. For this study, a total of 10 mixtures were prepared with different substitutes (in terms of weight) for RBA (0%, 25%, 50% and 100%) and GBFS (0%, 25%, 50% and 70%), while normal steel fiber (0%, 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.5%), 0.5% stapler pin steel fiber and 0.5% polypropylene fibers were added (in terms of volume). The compressive strength and flexural tensile strength were tested for each concrete mixture. Here, the compressive strength and flexural tensile strengths were reduced when using GBFS, RBA and fibers, and the extreme reduction of compressive strength and flexural tensile strength was 50% and 55%, respectively, for 70% GBFS, 25% RBA and 0.5% normal steel fiber. The less decreasing in compressive strength and flexural tensile strength was for a mix of 25% GBFS, 25% RBA and 0.5% stapler pin steel fiber. The role of fiber, GBFS and RBA was more promised in the behavior of reinforced concrete beams. There was an enhancement in flexural capacity for all reinforced concrete beams reaching 27.7%, furthermore when made via using 25%GBFS, 25% RBA and 1.5% normal steel fiber. According to the obtained test data, the utilization of GBFS, RBA, and fibers made the reinforced concrete beams more ductile compared with reference one."

We propose tramp shipping, liner shipping, and a mixed mode to select the optimal shipping mode, considering transshipment and consolidation to exploit economies of scale under a given network. We present mathematical formulations of tramp, liner and mixed modes and apply a piecewise approximation technique with mixed-linear integer programming to linearly approximate the concave minimization problem and efficiently solve it using an off-the-shelf solver. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed modes, the three modes are compared and discussed in numerical examples. The advantages and disadvantage of the three modes are discussed under different situations. The result is a decision aided system to support production-shipping planning in selecting the optimal transportation mode."	"This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP20K14987."

However, the determination of optimal plans for production is a challenging task due to high computational cost and various nonlinear constraints. Therefore, an efficient methodology is required to determine the optimum criteria with minimum cost and maximum precision. In this paper, two quasi-newton second-order algorithms of the BroydenFletcherGoldfarbShanno (BFGS) and symmetric rank one (SR1) are used to maximize the net-present-value (NPV) over 17 years of production and injection. The framework is applied to an integrated simulation model of reservoir, wells, and surface facilities of a real oil field located in the Middle East. The Lagrangian method is used to combine the objective function and constraints during optimization. The results obtained are compared with those of the current production scheduled plan provided by the oil industry. The performance of algorithms is affected by the production optimization time scale. For the first 12 years of production optimization, SR1 outperform BFGS. For the last 5 years, BFGS outperforms SR1. However, for all years of production, BFGS is superior over SR1 and increases NPV over the base case NPV from 1.605% to 4.92% for various time steps of production."

In recent years, several drug delivery systems have been introduced, such as liposomes, niosomes, transfersomes, and pharmacosomes. N-acetylcysteine, as a mucolytic agent, is prescribed for acute diseases and respiratory disorders, flu, colds, and bronchitis to reduce mucus viscosity. In this study, niosomes n-acetyl cysteine was prepared with a hydration thin film layer method. Niosome formation was confirmed by light and electron microscope images. To determine the average size of niosomes, zeta seizer instruments were used. To evaluate the effects of the medicine on niosomes membrane composition, Fourier transforms infrared spectra were obtained. The best formulation for this study was the Span 60 formula with a 70:30 ratio. An increase in drug concentration was accompanied by a similar rise in niosome capacity. The average size of niosome with different formulations was listed. The release time of the drug was obtained. The FTIR spectroscopy of pure drug, niosome, and niosome with drugs were taken. When the cholesterol was increased from 30% micromole to 50% micromole, niosome average size was increased. The molar ratio 70: 30 of span and cholesterol was more appropriate for the preparation of niosome drug delivery. By adding distill phosphate and acetyl Tri-methyl ammonium bromide to niosomeal compounds, the average vesicle size and the loading percentage were increased."

"WOS:000585335500005"	"Yes"	"bronze, bronze"	"This paper proposes, designs, and analyses a novel nonlinear feedback controller that realizes fast, and oscillation free convergence of the synchronization error to the equilibrium point. Oscillation free convergence lowers the failure chances of a closed-loop system due to the reduced chattering phenomenon in the actuator motion, which is a consequence of low energy sm ooth control signal. The proposed controller has a novel structure. This controller does not cancel nonlinear terms of the plant in the closed-loop; this attribute improves the robustness of the loop. The controller consists of linear and nonlinear parts; each part executes a specific task. The linear term in the controller keeps the closed-loop stable, while the nonlinear part of the controller facilitates the fast convergence of the error signal to the vicinity of the origin. Then the linear controller synthesizes a smooth control signal that moves the error signals to zero without oscillations. The nonlinear term of the controller does not contribute to this synthesis. The collaborative combination of linear and nonlinear controllers that drive the synchronization errors to zero is innovative. The paper establishes proof of global stability and convergence behavior by describing a detailed analysis based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Computer simulation results of two numerical examples verify the performance of the proposed controller approach. The paper also provides a comparative study with state-of-the-art controllers."

If the plant satisfies a certain phase condition then a monotone nonlinearity can be constructed so that the Lurye system has a non-trivial periodic cycle. Several examples are provided to demonstrate the construction. This represents a contribution for absolute stability analysis since the constructed nonlinearity provides a less conservative upper bound than existing bounds in the literature."

Material and Methods: This randomised, two-armed, within-subject, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial included 76 children. Eligible participants were treated in two dental visits using the following methods: with protective glasses only, without distraction (attention placebo-controlled - APC); and with the treatment condition (i.e., VR). Primary outcomes were dental anxiety and pain; secondary outcome was dental visit behaviour. Heart rate scores were recorded as an objective measure to evaluate dental anxiety and pain. Subjective measurements for each variable were also performed. Results: Significant reduction in dental pain and anxiety was observed in the VR group, according to the heart rate scores; however, no statistical differences were observed according to the self-reported measures. Decreased dental anxiety and pain were associated with the first visit sequence with VR. Dental pain and anxiety scores were lower during local anaesthesia in the VR group than in the APC group.

Anomaly detection is crucial in some applications such as healthcare monitoring systems, forest fire information systems, and other internet of things (IoT) systems. This paper proposes a Gaussian distribution-based supervised machine learning scheme of anomaly detection (GDA) for healthcare monitoring sensor cloud, which is an integration of various body sensors of different patients and cloud. This work is implemented in Python. Use of Gaussian statistical model in the proposed scheme improves precision, throughput, and efficiency.

We use a laboratory SAXS system for planar imaging of AD model and control mouse brains slices to detect regions with high density of amyloid plaques. These regions were validated with histology methods. Using Monte Carlo techniques, we simulate SAXS computed tomography (SAXS-CT) system to study the potential of selectively differentiating amyloid targets in mouse and human head phantoms with detailed anatomy. We found contrast between amyloid and brain tissue at small q (below 0.8 nm(-1)) in the neocortex region of the transgenic brain slices as supported by histology. We observed similar behavior through planar SAXS imaging of an amyloid-like fibril deposit with a 0.8 mm diameter at a known location on a wild type mouse brain. In our SAXS-CT simulations, we found that 33-keV x rays provide increase plaque visibility in the mouse head for targets of at least 0.1 mm in diameter, while in the human head, 70-keV x rays were capable of detecting plaques as small as 2 mm. To increase radiation efficiency, we used a weighted-sum image visualization approach allowing the dose deposited by 70-keV x rays per SAXS-CT slice of the human head to be reduced by a factor of 10 to 71 mGy for gray matter and 63 mGy for white matter. The findings suggest that a dedicated SAXS-CT system for in vivo amyloid imaging in small animals and humans can be successfully developed with further system optimization to detect regions with amyloid plaques in the brain with a safe level of radiation dose."

Reliable air quality prediction can reduce the impact it has on the nearby population and ecosystem; hence, improving air quality prediction is the prime objective for the society. The air quality data collected from sensors usually contains deviant values called outliers which have a significant detrimental effect on the quality of prediction and need to be detected and eliminated prior to decision making. The effectiveness of the outlier detection method and the clustering methods in turn depends on the effective and efficient choice of parameters like initial centroids and number of clusters, etc. The authors have explored the hybrid approach combining k-means clustering optimized with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to optimize the cluster formation, thereby improving the efficiency of the prediction of the environmental pollution."

Method: a cross-sectional study was carried out with 38 girls and 32 boys (age range between 14 and 17 years old), out of which 35.72% performed AG as an after-school activity, whilst 64.28% did not practice any extracurricular activity. Body mass index (BMI) and BI perception were recorded using the Adolescent Silhouette Test. Results: 55% of non-practice girls would like to be thin compared to 22% of practice. BMI satisfaction rate was higher in the AG practice group (68%) than in non-practice group (35%), without significant differences. This satisfaction is more accentuated by gender, since boys (85%) and girls (61%) who practiced AG showed greater satisfaction compared to non-practice AG boys (36%) and girls (35%). A total of 40% of participants in the non-practice group and 45% of the AG practitioners showed no BI distortion. Regarding gender, AG girls showed less distortion (50%) compared to those who do not practice (35%), being this proportion similar in boys, with 42% and 44% respectively.

Starting from the debate that surrounds his films La citta delle donne (City of Women) (1980), Amarcord (1973) and II Casanova di Federico Fellini (Fellini's Casanova) (1976), this article analyses the bonds between Fellini and the feminist movement in the 1970s, and it focuses on the role played by feminist magazines in the director's public image construction. The problematic relationship between Fellini and the feminist movement and ideologies will be analysed especially through a review of feminist magazines such as Quotidiano donna and Effe.

With the aim of explaining how Fellini's image has been interpreted from different visual perspectives, I consider two basic questions: what relationship does Fellini have to the images of himself and of Italian culture? And why have images in Fellini's films and his own public image been the object of constant reinterpretations in film, advertising and on social networks? Focusing on the rereading of Fellini's image in the comics of Milo Manara, this article explores a phenomenon that distinguishes Fellini's filmmaking: his role as a circulator of images of classical and popular culture out of the past and into the future. The figure of Hermes, the god of mediation, constitutes the archetype through which we can understand this central role of Fellini."

The conceptual model is developed with the help of extant literature and expert opinion. The study analyzes the relationship among the store attributes, customer satisfaction, advocacy, and repurchase intention to provide operational insights to retail store managers concerning key store attributes. In particular, jewellery stores in India are selected for this research investigation. The data from jewellery stores and customers located in the Gwalior district is collected using the convenience sampling. The partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method is used for model validation and data analysis. The results reveal that the store-related attributes, product-related attributes, and service quality-related attributes have a positive influence over customer satisfaction. In these three attribute categories, the most sought factors by consumers were store layout & ambience, product durability, and overall assistance, respectively. Further, the customer satisfaction is found to affect advocacy and repurchase intention. The study suggests that jewellery store managers should focus on managing the select store attributes identified in this study to improve customer satisfaction, advocacy, and repurchase intentions. Though the study is conducted in the context of Indian jewellery stores, the insights are equally useful and explorable in other retail stores situated at diverse locations."

In this study, the healing effect of a mixed herbal ointment (containing Myrtus, honey, Aloe vera, and pseudomonas phage) on the healing process of second degree burn wounds infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in comparison was evaluated. For this purpose, a hot metal square piece (4x2 cm, 50 g) was applied using a standard burning technique, and the applied pressure on the skin kept the same for all animals, then infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Rats were randomly divided into 2 groups. Group 1 was treated with mixed herbal ointment, and group 2 received no treatment (control group). The treatment was daily, and sampling was weekly for three consecutive weeks (7, 14, and 21-day). Formalin 10% was used for tissue fixation. Wound healing in test and control groups was investigated by macroscopic and microscopic methods using Hematoxylin-Eosin staining. It wound contraction evaluation (Image J software). Macroscopic findings showed that wound contraction of the mixed herbal ointment group was significantly higher than the control group for 21 days. Hematoxylin-Eosin staining revealed that the epithelialization was considerably more completed in the mixed herbal ointment group in comparison with the control group. Also, neovascularization was significantly higher in the mixed herbal ointment group. The comparative results demonstrated that the mixed herbal ointment group had a significant difference (P<0.05) with a non-treated group (control). Therefore, the mixed herbal ointment is suggested as a suitable candidate for the treatment of second-degree burn wounds infected to pseudomonas aeruginosa."

Main results: Based on the proposed model, it was possible to verify that the phases evidenced and that occur before the recognition of sustainable opportunities were contemplated. However, the non-linearity and recursion that comprise such steps are factors that deserve to be highlighted. Although the model suggests that (i) knowledge about the natural / community environment, it emphasizes the ability to (ii) perceive environmental issues surrounding such an environment and, motivated by an interest in helping society, leads sustainable entrepreneurs to (iii) recognize potential opportunities, the case investigated presented a different configuration.

It is assumed that an agent can only transmit its position to its neighbors at asynchronous and aperiodic discrete time instants. Velocity and acceleration of the agents are not available. Moreover, the dynamics of the leader can be controlled through an external input. Using continuous-discrete time observers, an output feedback formation controller is designed to drive the agents to a desired formation shape and to ensure that the formation tracks the leader trajectory under directed communication topology. A potential function based mechanism is incorporated into the proposed formation tracking algorithm to avoid collision between agents. The simulation results have shown the efficacy of the proposed algorithm."

This method overcomes the issues related to the computation of frequency response of LTP systems by utilizing the frequency response of the time-lifted system with linear time-invariant structure instead. The response is estimated with an ensemble of input-output data with periodic inputs. This allows the frequency-domain subspace identification technique to be extended to LTP systems. The time-aliased periodic impulse response can then be estimated and the order-revealing decomposition of the block-Hankel matrix is formulated. The consistency of the proposed method is proved under mild noise assumptions. Numerical simulation shows that the proposed method performs better than multiple widely-used time-domain subspace identification methods when an ensemble of periodic data is available."

A total of 21 players (age 21.2 +/- 2.4) grouped by specific positions (forwards: n = 9; 166.3 +/- 12.6 cm; 65.4 +/- 7.2 kg; and backs :n = 12; 163.4 +/- 9.8cm; 61.7 +/- 4.1 kg) were monitored in official competition tournaments, using a global positioning system (GPS). To determine a sprint, an individual threshold of 61% of the maximum speed of each player was considered. The results show that, when analyzing the group of players (p < .05), there are significant differences in the maximum speed (27.0 +/- 2.10 vs 24.7 +/- 1.65), in maximum speed in competition (25.9 +/- 2.34 vs 21.9 +/- 2.59), threshold of sprint (16.4 +/- 1.29 vs 15.0 +/- 1.0), sprint number (6.83 +/- 1.88 vs 4.54 +/- 1.44), distance traveled to sprint (166.0 +/- 15.64 vs 135 +/- 13.94), and repeated sprint (1.82 +/- .76 vs. 1.11 +/- .31) Significant differences were found between both periods of play (p < .05), observing a considerable decrease of the maximum speed in competition, the number of sprints, distance traveled to sprints, and repeated sprints during the second half. The use of relative thresholds increases the number of sprints. The differences in playing positions can help us to better understand the demands of competition and optimize training planning."

The objective of this international, multicentre care improvement programme was to investigate errors in inhaler use (handling errors and inhalation errors) made by patients in handling two dry powder inhalers; DuoResp (R) Spiromax (R) and Symbicort (R) Turbuhaler (R). Patients with asthma or COPD aged between 18 and 80 years attending the allergology/pneumology departments of 14 hospitals in Spain and Portugal were included. All assessments were performed during one regular scheduled visit to the study clinic. Among 161 eligible patients (138 with asthma; 23 with COPD), inhalation errors were the most common type of error, with no significant difference between devices in overall total error rate, handling error rate or inhalation error rate. Significantly fewer total errors per patient (1.4 vs. 1.9;p< 0.001) and handling errors per patient (0.5 vs. 0.8;p< 0.001) were observed with DuoResp (R) Spiromax (R) compared with Symbicort (R) Turbuhaler (R). The mean number of attempts for patients using DuoResp (R) Spiromax (R) to perform two correct procedures was 1.9 (0.6) compared with 2.1 (0.9) attempts for patients using Symbicort (R) Turbuhaler (R) (p= 0.016). Compared with Symbicort (R) Turbuhaler (R), DuoResp (R) Spiromax (R) was found to be easy to learn how to use (p< 0.001), easy to prepare (p< 0.001), easy to use (p< 0.001), comfortable in terms of weight and size (p= 0.001), and patients felt that they were using the device correctly (p< 0.001). Overall, 79.5% of patients stated that they preferred DuoResp (R) Spiromax (R) as their first option over Symbicort (R) Turbuhaler (R). The findings of this study may be useful in developing effective inhaler training programmes and thus improve outcomes in asthma and COPD."	"This study was supported by Teva Pharmaceuticals Spain.

The preconcentration of cadmium(II) ions was performed using polyvinyl chloride functionalized with 3-(2-thiazolylazo)-2,6-diaminopyridine in a minicolumn system. The adsorbed cadmium(II) ions were then eluted from the sorbent by the eluent. The important influencing parameters such as the sample solution pH, type and concentration of the eluent used for stripping cadmium(II) ions from the sorbent, flow rate of the sample and the eluent, and the amount of adsorbent were investigated in detail. Under the optimum experimental conditions, the linear dynamic range of the method was found to be in the range of 2.0-40.0 mu.g l(-1) (with the determination coefficient equal to 0.9987). The limit of detection and improvement factor were 0.7 mu.g l(-1) and 52.4, respectively. The inter assay precession (RSD%, n = 7) was in the range of 0.8-4.1% at the concentration levels of 5.00, 9.00 and 25.0 mu.g l(-1).

Chitosan (Cs), cellulose (Cel), starch (Str) and gelatin (Gel) as well as their blends as Cs/Cel; Cs/Str; Cs/Gel with ratios 3:1; 2:2; 1:3 were subjected to molecular modeling. These biopolymers, as well as their blends, are calculated with quantum mechanical calculations at PM6 level of theory. QSAR, surface area, and volume properties of the interaction of phenol and HMC upon Cs/Cel; Cs/Str; Cs/Gel in the different positions of the four units are calculated at the same level of theory. QSAR descriptors for studied polymers show a change in their physical properties as result of blending. Depending on QSAR calculations, the interaction of phenol and HMC with Cs/Cel and Cs/Str blends for ratio 1:3 through the first unit increases the reactivity of these modified structures. The solubility of modified blends is increased by increasing chitosan units in the proposed modified blends. The surface area of modified Cs/Cel ratios increases comparing with modified Cs/Str and Cs/Gel ratios. This recommends the modified blends of Cs/Cel ratio can be used as promising HIV protease inhibitors drugs."

The use of cell therapy and applying stem cell-based therapies has received much attention; of particular interest are adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs). The present review aimed to review the studies which examined and researched various aspects of ADSCs to improve cardiac function. A comprehensive review of all articles assessed and discussed the application of ADSCs in the improvement of cardiac tissue renewing and cardiomyocytes regeneration was planned and conducted by the two reviewers. The initial literature search revealed a total of 153 articles that, of those, 34 were considered eligible. From the perspective of heart tissue regeneration, the inductive role of ADSCs in sensing mechanical stimulation and produce collagen and elastin scaffolds, vascularizing cardiac tissue, and exosomes (vesicles derived from ADSCs) in ADSCs-mediated myocardial protection has indicated. In the process of ADSCs differentiation to cardiomyocyte- like cells, the role of various targeted pathways have been identified that can be influenced by different elements such as TGF-beta1, phorbol myristate acetate, Angiotensin II, Rho-associated kinases, 5-Azaytidine, Sodium valproate, fibrin scaffold and trichostatin A have been highlighted. In the final, from a therapeutic point of view, the effectiveness of ADMSCs differentiation to cardiomyocytes as improving left ventricular functional state has been discussed. Summarizing the studies confirms a significant improvement in cardiac function following direct application of ADSCs or their transformation to cardiomyocytes by stimulating or inhibiting various cellular pathways leading reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory bed, reducing cardiomyocyte apoptosis, attenuating cardiac fibrosis, reducing the infiltration of immune cells and collagen deposition, and enhancing angiogenesis."

Previous studies analyse the importance of motricity in early childhood schools from a point of view of the teachers, but we consider relevant to know the viewpoint of the future teachers in order to enhance the training of college students. The present exploratory study is of a descriptive cross-sectional type with a quantitative approach, using a survey intended to assess the perceptions of students in Early Childhood Education Teacher in relation to the situation of motor practice in the classrooms. Specifically, aspects related to their perception towards their initial training on motricity are addressed. A sample of 36 students enrolled in the subject of Corporal Education and Motricity from the 4th Grade in Early Chilhood Education Teacher at the Faculty of Teacher Training of the University of Extremadura (Caceres) was selected. All of them were women, aged between 21 and 25 years. To measure students' perceptions, we used the Questionnaire for the Analisys of Motricity in Early Chilhood Education (Moreno, et al., 2004). Results allow us to conclude that students perceive that it is important to work motricity in the classrooms, but most of them indicate that work put into it is not enough. Furthermore, it was observed that the competence on motor practice in future teachers presents some shortcomings. In view of the results, in higher education, it seems interesting to guide teaching and learning strategies towards enhancing the training of college students."

Objective: The purpose of this review was to identify and synthesize the most important literature on the effects of relative age (ER), training volume (TV), early specialization (ES), and diversification of sports practice. (DSP) in sports success. Methodology: online search was made in PubMed, ScienceDirect, SPORTDiscus (EBSCOhost), Science, Social Science, Web of Science, Scirus, Hinari, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, Scopus and Ovid using the keywords: relative age effect, early sport specialization, volume training, sports diversification. After selection based on the established criteria, 77 articles were included. They were completely reviewed and contained relevant data on ER, TV, ET, and DSP. The quality of the evidence reviewed was excellent in general terms. Conclusion: scientific evidence indicates that success in elite and super-elite athletes is not correlated with TV, ES, ER. These findings must be carefully considered by all those involved in the identification and development of athletes."

It corresponds to an investigation with a quantitative approach, explanatory scope and non -experimental design, which included the participation of 650 teachers from 10 Units of Local Educational Management, to whom a scale of perception of educational management and a self-assessment questionnaire of the teaching performance, both valid and reliable; The analyzes were performed based on a significance level of 5% and a confidence level of 95%. The results show a direct and significant correlation between the variable educational management and teacher performance (r =.623, p <.05), in the same way with the institutional management dimensions (r =.523, p <.05), Pedagogical management (r =.499, p <0.05), Administrative management (r =.611, p <.05) and Community management (r =.514, p <.05). In addition to this, the multiple linear regression model explains the effect that the educational management variable and its dimensions have on the teaching performance of teachers in Puno. It is concluded that educational management, which can be understood as the strengthening of Educational Projects and the enrichment of pedagogical processes in order to respond to local and regional educational needs, is a determining factor that explains the level of performance they achieve teachers of Regular Basic Education in Puno during the COVID19 Pandemic."

The local strain distributions in the bimetal low-carbon steel base layer at the yield point stage are presented by the two strain localization bands that are similar to the !Alders bands. Analogous distributions arise at the yield point from the bimetal austenite stainless steel clad layer in the form of two strain localization fronts that are identical to the Portevin-Le Chatelier bands. Finally, the generation of strain localization bands is described in the context of a solid-state wedging model."

This paper investigates the untrusted users of cryptocurrency transaction services, which are connected using smartphones and computers. However, as technology is increasing, transaction frauds are growing, and there is a need to detect vulnerabilities in systems. A methodology is proposed to identify suspicious users based on their reputation score by collaborating centrality measures and machine learning techniques. The results are validated on two cryptocurrencies network datasets, Bitcoin-OTC, and Bitcoin-Alpha, which contain information of the system formed by the users and the user's trust score. Results found that the proposed approach provides improved and accurate results. Hence, the fusion of machine learning with centrality measures provides a highly robust system and can be adapted to prevent smart devices' financial services."
