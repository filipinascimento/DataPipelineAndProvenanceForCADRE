"WOS:000556633800010"	"Yes"	"gold_other"	"Freight transportation can impact the effectiveness of smart city development if it is not welt planned. Commodities with international flows such as soy can cause traffic in urban areas where ports are installed, negatively influencing economic (e.g. delays and fines), social (e.g. population quality of life) and environmental (e.g. intensification of pollutant and greenhouse gases emissions) dimensions. Thus, this paper aims to apply a location-allocation mathematical model to determine the ideal location of logistics integration centers - LICs dedicated to soybean transportation. We believe that, by property locating structures that allow intermodatity, the use of road transport would decrease by replacing it with intermodal alternatives with less environmental impact, reducing road congestion in urban centers under port influence. In addition, the total costs of the network would be optimized, promoting positive economic impacts on the soybean logistics chains. Therefore, eight scenarios were established varying the model's input parameters (such as investment and minimum volume of soybean moved through a LIC). The model was implemented in the Mosel language using the Xpress WE solver version 1.24.24. The costs of each scenario were investigated, and the benefits related to the currently configuration (with no LIC) were pointed out. In the end, it was observed that the applied model might support government strategic planning (including, here, the design of smart cities)."

They have recently been used in various biomedical applications. In this study injectable hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels were prepared using different concentrations of 1.4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE) as a crosslinker (1-5% w/w) and investigated their rheological. swelling and injectability properties. The results demonstrated that the theological characteristics of hydrogels enhanced with increasing crosslinker concentration. The elastic modulus of the hydrogels ranged from 280 Pa to 990 Pa. while the complex viscosities were found between 42 Pa.s and 190 Pa.s at an oscillation frequency of 1 Hz, These results clearly suggest that the injectable HA hydrogels are a potential candidate for various soft tissue engineering applications due to their highly tunable rheological properties."

The aim of our research was to determine the content of amino acids in these plants with the future prospects of their application as officinal medicinal plant raw material. The amino acids of the leaves of cultivated species of the genus Primula L. determined by the HPLC method. 16 free and 16 bound amino acids were identified in the cultivated species of Primula L. High concentrations of the free amino acids that as L-glutamic acid, L-aspartic acid, and L-alanine predominate in all the plants analyzed. Among the bound amino acids in the leaves of cultivated Primula species prevail, L-glutamic acid, L-aspartic acid, L-lysine, and L-leucine. The results show that rock primrose, Julias primrose, and drumstick primrose are the rich source of amino acids.

The aim of this study was to compare kinematic and electromyographic variables in both lower limbs at facing an obstacle, with (WC) and without (WoC) the use of a cell phone. Ten young women were evaluated, while walking and facing an obstacle WC and WoC. A 3D biomechanical model was used to evaluate the lower limb kinematics (hip, knee, ankle in the sagittal plane, together with toe clearance). At the same time, the electromyographic (EMG) activity was registered in the following muscles: tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius medialis (GM), rectus femoris (RF) and biceps femoris (BF). The mean EMG amplitude of each muscle and the muscular coactivation percentage between: TA-GM and RA-BF were calculated. The strategy for both lower limbs considering the first (P1) and the second step (P2) were analyzed when crossing the obstacle, comparing between gait WC vs WoC. According to results, the gait WC increase the toe clearance, hip flexion, and the GM amplitude, observed both in P1 as P2 when the person crossed the obstacle. Furthermore, the P2 revealed an increase in the knee and ankle flexion. On the other hand, the TA amplitude and the muscular coactivation between TA-GM also increased WC in the P2. In conclusion, the kinematic and electromyographic variables in the lower limbs are modified when crossing an obstacle WC. These findings could indicate a protective strategy during the dual-task evaluated, minimizing the risk of falling."

The completion was developed with all athletes, in the gymnasium located in the Atanasio Girardot Sport Complex in Medellin. The 83 subjects were distributed ramdonly using shuffle numbers (62 to the experimental group and 21 to the control group). From those 41 were male (49.4%), mainly from number two social standing, according to Colombia establishments (56 meaning 67.5%), with an age average of 15.9 years old (+/- 3), 53.2kg of body weight and 144.5cm height (+/- 53.7). The T-Force (R) (Dynamic measurement system) and the Smith cabin (A adjustable mechanical system for the knee angle) were applied to the power measurement to which three evaluators were trained for. This measuring procedure used progressive charges until the maximum power capacity was obtained. Due to Modelating theories a specific plan was applied, with strength-power component as the focused variant. The training plan for the experimental group lasted eight weeks, twice a week, beginning with three basic power micro cycles (with low intensity charges, 30%), then two stiength-power micro cycles (middle intensity, 40-50%) and two power-speed micro cycles (middle intensity, 50%) at last. The results show a maximum power significant growth (p<.05, 14% compared with the pm-test) in the experimental group, since the control group (which did sports without power training) remained standardized. As a conclusion, applying a modelating plan based on low charges in term of effiort, always attaining less repetitions than the possible amount in higher speed, increases significantly the power in young athletes."

Population initialization is the current ongoing research problem in evolutionary computing algorithms. Appropriate population initialization assists the algorithm to investigate the swarm search space effectively. BA faces premature convergence problem to find actual global optimization value. Low discrepancy sequences are slightly lesser random number than pseudo-random; however, they are more powerful for computational approaches. In this work, new population initialization approach Halton (BA-HA), Sobol (BA-SO), and Torus (BA-TO) are proposed, which helps bats to avoid from the premature convergence. The proposed approaches are examined on standard benchmark functions, and simulation results are compared with standard BA initialized with uniform distribution. The results depict that substantial enhancement can be attained in the performance of standard BA while varying the random numbers sequences to low discrepancy sequences."

To address this problem, this letter proposes a novel iterative feedback tuning method for cascade control. The proposed method adopts a cost function that is designed taking into consideration the cascade control structure and utilizes it for the IFT algorithm to simultaneously tune the inner and outer control loops. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experiments using a two-inertia system which is subject to vibration.

It is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value. Dobrovnik et al (2018) suggest that blockchain is a revolutionising technology that would change industries at an international level, add values to firms and supply chain networks, improve commerce, and drive economy. Although blockchain has attracted attentions, very few blockchain studies have been focussed on supply chain integration and collaboration areas. This study illustrates the possibilities of applying blockchain technology in the coordination of activities for effective and efficient supply chain management. The study takes a closer look at the use of blockchain in supply chains beyond cryptocurrency, payment, and finance via the use of smart contract and consensus algorithm (i.e., imposing constraints). The key attributes of blockchain are discussed and potential questions were identified in New Zealand. The expected outcome of this study will advance the understanding of the blockchain and supply chain literature, besides inspire both researchers and practitioners to consider the use of blockchain in different context-aware future studies."

This study points out processes of recognition, classification and nomenclature of sharks achieved by fishermen from South Bahia, Brazil. Data were obtained through semi-structured interviews visually stimulated by exhibiting images of 30 species of elasmobranch fishes. Regionally, elasmobranch species are inserted into the folk taxon called leather fishes and in a category known as cacao (shark) family. In addition to hierarchical classification, the fishermen organize shark species by adopting an ethnodimorphic and sequential model based on ethnoontogeny. Ethnodiagnostic characteristics are mainly related to the morphology, ecology and even physiology of a species. A total of 144 epithets is recorded, with a mean value of 4.8 ethnospecies for each scientific correspondent. Richness of vernacular names impedes species-specific information gathering regarding shark landings if fisher knowledge is not considered and applied in the improvement of fisheries data. Thus, this study encourages the employment of fishermen as parataxonomists in order to assist in the identification of sharks to specific levels. This study further emphasizes the potential of using ethnotaxonomic knowledge of fishing communities in initiatives related to participative management of shark fisheries in developing countries."

The author of the paper argues that this process should be based on the principles of folk pedagogy and ethno-p ogy, since it is precisely under the current conditions of globalization and unification of cultures that they can ensure the continuity of generations in the Republic of Kazakhstan in preserving and enhancing national traditions and values of training and education. The author suggests creating a healthy lifestyle for children in classroom and extracurricular activities, attracting prominent Kazakh scientists, writers, poets, local historians, artists to the process, including setting up sightseeing walking tours around Kazakhstan, which will provide younger students with physical activity, necessary knowledge and will facilitate the development of healthy habits associated with maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

The Danish Severe Asthma Register (DSAR) was designed as an electronic patient record form that captures operational clinical data and provides a clinical overview of the severe asthma patient. DSAR is a nationwide register; all patients in Denmark who are treated with biologics for severe asthma are included, and data are as a minimum entered at start of biological treatment, after four and 12 months of treatment, and hereafter annually. Currently, there are data from 621 treatment courses with biologics included in DSAR, with 71% of patients treated with anti-IL-5 drugs and 29% with an anti-IgE drug. Patients enter Patient Reported Outcome Measures electronically on tablets when they arrive in the outpatient clinic and their answers are immediately available to the clinician during the consultation. Nurses and doctors enter clinical data into DSAR during the consultation. DSAR offers immediate access to well-presented longitudinal overview and automatically creates a journal output that can be copy-pasted into the hospital's existing health record form. DSAR is also currently expanding with an app, to be used for monitoring of home-treatment. In addition to serving as an electronic patient record form, DSAR will also provide opportunities to monitor the real-life efficacy of biological treatment for severe asthma in Denmark, and it will be a valuable research platform that will aid in answering important research questions on severe asthma in the future."

In spite of the lack of convexity, we establish that the random search method with two-point gradient estimates and a fixed number of roll-outs achieves epsilon-accuracy in O(log (1/epsilon)) iterations.

In digital image processing task, enhancing the image quality and reducing the noise is a central process. Image denoising effectively preserves the image edges to a higher extend in the flat regions. Several adaptive filters (median filter, Gaussian filter, fuzzy filter, etc.) have been utilized to improve the smoothness of digital image, but these filters failed to preserve the image edges while removing noise. In this paper, a modified fuzzy set filter has been proposed to eliminate noise for restoring the digital image. Usually in fuzzy set filter, sixteen fuzzy rules are generated to find the noisy pixels in the digital image. In modified fuzzy set filter, a set of twenty-four fuzzy rules are generated with additional four pixel locations for determining the noisy pixels in the digital image. The additional eight fuzzy rules ease the process of finding the image pixels, whether it required averaging or not. In this scenario, the input digital images were collected from the underwater photography fish dataset. The efficiency of the modified fuzzy set filter was evaluated by varying degrees of Gaussian noise (0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 levels of Gaussian noise). For performance evaluation, Structural Similarity (SSIM), Mean Structural Similarity (MSSIM), Mean Square Error (MSE), Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE), Universal Image Quality Index (UIQI), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) were used. The experimental results showed that the modified fuzzy set filter improved PSNR value up to 2-3 dB, MSSIM up to 0.12-0.03, and NMSE value up to 0.38-0.1 compared to the traditional filtering techniques."

A class of CT systems for which the existence condition for the UIO holds in the discrete-time (DT) domain is characterized. The proposed digital estimators are tested on a nonlinear networked control system (NCS).

Many health-related datasets comprising categorical data are faced with the class imbalance challenge. This paper aims to address the limitations of imbalanced two class categorical data and presents a re-sampling solution known as `Syn_Gen_Min' (SGM) to improve the class imbalance ratio. SGM involves finding the greedy neighbors for a given minority sample. To the best of one's knowledge, the accepted approach for a classifier is to find the numeric equivalence for categorical attributes, resulting in the loss of information. The novelty of this contribution is that the categorical attributes are kept in their raw form. Five distinct categorical similarity measures are employed and tested against six real-world datasets derived within the healthcare sector. The application of these similarity methods leads to the generation of different synthetic samples, which has significantly improved the performance measures of the classifier. This work further proves that there is no generic similarity measure that fits all datasets."

The proposed approach exploits an equivalent representation of these systems as the feedback interconnection of a linear system and a diagonal static block with repeated scalar nonlinearity. This representation enables the use of analysis results for systems with repeated nonlinearities based on integral quadratic constraints. This leads to a sufficient condition for L-2-stability that can be checked via the solution of a single linear matrix inequality, whose dimension grows linearly with the number of basis piecewise affine functions defining the system. Numerical examples corroborate the proposed approach by providing a comparison with an alternative approach based on the computation of piecewise polynomial storage functions."

But the realization of a tunable bandgap structure for zero-bandgap graphene at all times persists as a dilemma. In this work, a green approach is adopted for the bandgap modulation of graphene oxide (GO). The biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were introduced into the graphene matrix, and hence the bandgap was tailored for the formation of a semiconductor composite. The bare GO that has got a bandgap of 3.41 eV was tuned to 2.33 eV on the addition of AgNPs. The preparation of AgNPs using fruit extract of cyanococcus make the process greener, safer, and cost-effective.

This study aims at investigating whether there is an association between the use of fitness devices, exercise addiction and trait anxiety. The investigation analyzes a simple of 102 users of fitness centers located in Zaragoza with a mean age of 30 years old. The study uses different questionnaires in order to evaluate: i) the use of technology (own questionnaire), exercise addiction (ExerciseAddic (ion Inventory) and iii) the level of trait anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory). Results indicates that most of the users use technology during their training sessions, being larger the percentage of men than women. Further, interesting associations between age and exercise addiction were found, as well as, between trait anxiety and exercise addiction. In addition, the study highlights that wearables and mobile apps are the trendy devices.

The cloud RAID survivability is concerned with the system's ability to function correctly even under the circumstance of hazardous behaviors including disk failures and malicious attacks. The cloud RAID invulnerability is concerned with the system's ability to function correctly while occupying some state immune to malicious attacks. A continuous-time Markov chains-based method is suggested to perform the disk level survivability and invulnerability analysis. Combinatorial methods are then presented for the cloud RAID system level analysis, which can accommodate both homogeneous (based on binomial coefficients) and heterogeneous (based on multi-valued decision diagrams) disks. A detailed case study on a cloud RAID 5 system is conducted to illustrate the application of the proposed methods. Impacts of different parameters on the disk and system survivability and invulnerability are also investigated through numerical analysis."

For both failure improvement and virtual age reduction of the system, maintenance efficiency is assumed to be random, with an exponential distribution as a probability density function. The likelihood function of this model is provided, and the estimation of the model parameters is computed by considering the maximization likelihood procedure.

Refering to the methodology: this research has been done by descriptive method and by studying written and historical works. Researchers have extracted material by examining historical books, articles and writings. In this study, we have tried to collect and sort out the problems of passengers. Results show that during Qajar Era, due to the strategic position of Iran and the Persian Gulf, this region was of particular interest to the superior international powers; therefore, travelers, statesmen, ambassadors, and merchants from many different European and non-European countries traveled to Iran. In these foreign delegations and political groups, there were also female figures, including Lady Sheil, Jane Dieulafoy, Gertrude Bell, Madame Wolfson, Isabella Bird Bishop and Carla Serena. Some of these women came to Iran as members of political delegations and some for tourism or economic purposes. Regarding their status and position, they provided Qajar officials with reports in which they addressed Iran's political problems, such as the government's failure in managing public health and justice, dealing with insecurity, widespread economic corruption among statesmen and other authorities of Qajar government, oppressions, and the like.

Universities and schools were mandated to close, and work-from-home orders were enacted in the majority of sectors. In this work, we make a review of events and a summary of the important factors, current situation, and future perspective regarding the effect generated by COVID-19 on the disruptions of supply chains. The strategic sectors summarized are food and produce, transportation, paper products, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, automobiles, minerals and technology companies. At six months since the WHO declaration, there are still shockwaves that show some unpredictability. Hence, companies and governments should look for strategical plans for preparing for this kind of event, making supply chains resilient or even immune to pandemics, natural disasters and trade wars."

Currently available treatments for this condition present several shortcomings and new options are continuously being developed and evaluated, aiming at increasing the overall treatment efficiency and reducing associated adverse side effects. Gemcitabine has proven activity and is used in chemotherapy. However, its therapeutic efficiency is limited by its low bioavailability as a result of rapid enzymatic inactivation. Additionally, tumor cells often develop drug resistance after initial tumor regression related to transporter deficiency. We have previously developed three gemcitabine conjugates with cell-penetrating hexapeptides (CPP6) to facilitate intracellular delivery of this drug while also preventing enzymatic deamination. The bioactivity of these new prodrugs was evaluated in different cell lines and showed promising results. Here, we assessed the absorption and permeability across Caco-2 monolayers of these conjugates in comparison with gemcitabine and the respective isolated cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). CPP6-2 (KLPVMW) and respective Gem-CPP6-2 conjugate showed the highest permeability in Caco-2 cells. (c) 2021 by the authors.

Estimating their macroscopic density is critical for many density-based optimization and control tasks, such as sensor deployment and city traffic scheduling. In this letter, we study the problem of estimating their dynamically varying probability density, given the agents' individual dynamics (which can be nonlinear and time-varying) and their states observed in real-time. The density evolution is shown to satisfy a linear partial differential equation uniquely determined by the agents' dynamics. We present a density filter which takes advantage of the system dynamics to gradually improve its estimation and is scalable to the agents' population. Specifically, we use kernel density estimators (KDE) to construct a noisy measurement and show that, when the agents' population is large, the measurement noise is approximately Gaussian. With this important property, infinite-dimensional Kalman filters are used to design density filters. It turns out that the covariance of measurement noise depends on the true density. This state-dependence makes it necessary to approximate the covariance in the associated operator Riccati equation, rendering the density filter suboptimal. The notion of input-to-state stability is used to prove that the performance of the suboptimal density filter remains close to the optimal one. Simulation results suggest that the proposed density filter is able to quickly recognize the underlying modes of the unknown density and automatically ignore outliers, and is robust to different choices of kernel bandwidth of KDE."

Differently from existing studies that leverage knowledge of the system dynamics to derive security bounds and monitoring schemes, we treat the cases where the system dynamics, as well as the attack strategy and attack location, are unknown. We derive fundamental security limitations as a function of only the observed data and without estimating the system dynamics (in fact, no assumption is made on the identifiability of the system). In particular, (i) we derive detection limitations as a function of the informativity and length of the observation window, (ii) provide a data-driven characterization of undetectable attacks, and (iii) construct a data-driven detection monitor. Surprisingly, our results show that while data-driven monitoring requires a larger observation window to attain attack detection capability, once attained it shares the same limitations as model-based monitoring."

Promising is the search for new pharmacological targets among the intracellular signaling molecules of regenerating-competent cells. In the conditions of in vitro and in vivo modeling of ethanol-induced neurodegeneration, the role of NF-kappa B in the realization of the growth potential of neural progenitors and the secretion of neurotrophins by glial elements was studied. The absence of participation of NF-kappa B in the regulation of mitotic activity of neural SC (NSC) and of neuronal-committed progenitors (NCP) in their optimal living conditions and in the influence of ethanol in vitro is shown. At the same time, NF-kappa B hinders the implementation of the NSC specialization process. The prolonged introduction of ethanol per os mice was accompanied by the appearance of an inhibitory value in NF-kappa B in relation to the intensity of progenitors proliferation. The blockade of NF-kappa B of NSC and NCP animals with neurodegeneration caused the progression of their cell cycle. The participation of NF-kappa B in the secretory function of astrocytes and oligodendrogliocytes has been established. The inactivation of the nuclear transcription factor led to a decrease in their production of neurotrophins, including in the case of ethanol. At the same time, there were no changes from the microglia functioning."	"This research was funded by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR), grant number 18-015-00013."

In this regard, the ITL profiles are scrutinized following the variation of several pertinent physical quantities with and without noise. Two different avenues viz. 'additive' and 'multiplicative' have been explored by which noise may be introduced to the system. Often, the presence of noise happens to alter the attributes of the ITL profiles (steady rise, steady fall, and maximization) from that under a noise-free state. And such alterations also prominently depend on the additive/multiplicative nature of noise. The present study clearly manifests the attainment of enhanced ITL of QDs containing dopants under applied Gaussian white additive noise having strength in the neighborhood of a typical value. The findings seem to have important bearings in designing and manufacturing QD-based optoelectronic devices where the role of noise needs to be acknowledged."	"The authors S. M. A., A. B., A.

There is a growing need in higher education for a learner-centered solution focused on individual preferences.

In this paper, they extend the work to present a solution that uses students' individualized achievements, expected future performance, and historical registration records to discover students' registration timing patterns, as well as the most appropriate courses for registration. Such information is then processed to build the most suitable timetable for each student in the following semester. Faculty members' time preferences are also predicted based on historical teaching time patterns and course teaching preferences. The authors propose a modified frequent pattern (FP)-tree algorithm to process the predicted information. This results in clustering students to solve the timetable problem based on the predicted courses for registration. Then, it divides the timetable problem into subproblems for resolution. This ensures that time will not conflict within the generated timetables while satisfying both the hard and soft constraints.

QCT and Mg-QCT complex. Also, Zn-QCT is toxic to zebrafish embryos compared to std. QCT and Mg-QCT complex. The results of this study suggest the usage of M-QCT complexes in the processed foodstuffs instead of pure QCT."

The primary objective of forestry has been considered as timber production, so the intangible benefits have never been given the proper attention they deserve. The majority of Turkey's wildlife has prospered within the forest ecosystems. This situation has gradually led to a change of status, so some forests and land areas have been reassigned with the conservation agendas as the primary purpose; however timber production has never slowed down. Thus, operational forestry practices, such as roading, logging, etc., have kept on exploiting these lands to their full extent despite their conservation statuses. In Turkey and anywhere else, since forestry has always evolved around extracting the timber out of the forest lands, the accessibility has long been provided, building roads to take related services to forested ecosystems. The remnants of these roads, along with the more standardized new ones can be found everywhere, regardless of the land status. Such expansion has resulted in habitat fragmentation emerging as a major threat for the protected areas. In this study, the expansion of all-weather and dry-weather accessible roads and suburban spread was examined in two adjacent, Ilgaz and Gavurdagi, wildlife refuges for the years of 1960, 1993, 2010 and 2019, relying heavily on the mapping, geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing. It was found that 275.5 km dry-weather roads in 1960 rose to 700 km in 2019, which meant 254% increase. Additionally, when the core along with the surrounding 3000 m buffer area was considered, 51 km all-weather roads in 1960 increased almost four and a half times by 2019. Suburban expansion was relatively stable inside the core area but had almost quadrupled within the surrounding areas, exposing the refuges to more people. These findings indicated that the wildlife habitats of Turkey are fragmented and under heavy human pressure."

The sample consisted of 309 Brazilian players in the top 10 European leagues, according to the ranking of UEFA club coefficients. The data were collected on the official websites of the clubs, and professional advancement was classified according to the level of participation in the European championships. Spearman's Correlation and Multinomial Logistic Regression tests (p d >> 0.05) were applied. Players born in the 2nd quarter of the year, as well as those born in the 3rd quarter, have the chance to play the Champions League, compared to the Europa League, increased by 84% and 67%, respectively, compared to those born in the 4th quarter (p = 0.01). In addition, it was identified that for every 1 cm of height, the chances of the player acting in a lower level team increased by 7% (p = 0.03). It is concluded that the RA and body size influence the professional rise of Brazilian soccer players working in Europe, while the HDI of the place of birth has limited impact on the level of competition disputed by these players."

The review indicates that there are different theoretical models used to understand attitudes, intentions and behaviors towards doping. Similarly, there are many individual, social and sport-specific factors that can influence doping practice.

This paper proposes a reliable trust computing mechanism based on subjective and objective trust. The subjective trust is calculated from feedback of multiple sources. The incentive and punishment mechanism is applied to the subjective trust to avoid malicious devices. The objective trust is calculated based on quality of services. The overall trust helps the IoT devices to determine the trustworthiness of other IoT devices and in turn helps to establish a trusted environment. The experimental results show that the performance is better than existing methods in terms of time required to calculate the overall trust, reliability, and trustworthiness of IoT devices."

A specially designed self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the responses. Chi-square test with a level of significance set at 5% was used for statistical analysis. Results: Parents (55%) followed by media (18%) were the major sources of oral health information among the study population, which was statistically not significant in relation to gender and school type. Many subjects (95.3%) perceived sweets could cause tooth decay; however, this was statistically significant only among school type (p<0.05). Around (45%) knew about fluoride and only 36% properly identified fluoride's action as preventing cavities. This was statistically significant among both gender and school type (p<0.05). Seventy-five percent of students effectively distinguished gum disease symptoms, which was significant only with gender (p<0.05). Around 55% identified that oral habits have an influence on oral health, which showed significance among gender (p<0.05).

This model, of North American origin, is practically unknown in Spain. Hence, the contributions of this work can be considered a true novelty. Its objective is twofold: to deepen knowledge of the CRE, which effectiveness is supported by numerous empirical researches, and to assess its translation to our context, in which students of immigrant origin tend to have lower average academic performance than their peers. Through the analysis of the most important literature on CRE, it has been possible: 1, to establish the most important theoretical characteristics of this pedagogical model, in relation to those of other concomitant and complementary approaches; 2, to estimate its impact on the improvement of the performance of culturally diverse students; and 3, to determine its possibilities and limitations of translation to our context. The results of this work show the great potential of CRE in improving the learning processes of culturally diverse students. Moreover, the importance of initial and ongoing teacher training in the development of this educational model is stressed, in addition to its valuable guidelines for pedagogical research and teaching practice."

Smaller oligomers, the intermediates during the process of aggregation, are known to be more neurotoxic than matured fibrils. To gain the insight into the toxicity of low molecular weight A beta(1-42) oligomers, it is essential to understand the course of its formation and the interactions involved. But the structural dynamics of A beta(1-42) oligomers at the atomistic level and the interactions holding the monomeric units in the oligomeric structures still remain elusive. In this study, using molecular dynamics simulations, we have investigated the structural dynamics of the toxic A beta(1-42) peptide intermediates and the interactions stabilizing the oligomers. From the structural dynamics of A beta(1-42) oligomers, we observed the significant number of secondary structural transitions from alpha-helix to random coils in some of the monomeric units. From the interaction study, we noticed the involvement of hydrophobic contacts and inter-molecular hydrogen bonds in stabilizing the oligomers. Additionally, we subjected the equilibrated structure of the oligomers in the PDBSum server to examine the proteinprotein interactions. The interaction results obtained from the PDBSum server was found to be consistent with the results obtained from the trajectory analysis"	"We would like to thank the Tezpur University for the start-up grant and DBT funded Bioinformatics Infrastructure facility in the Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at Tezpur University for providing us computational facility to carry out this research work."

Material and Methods: The compomer samples of different colors and viscosities (flowable compomers; blue-pink and packable compomers; A2-blue-pink-gold) were prepared in molds with an inner diameter of 5 mm and a height of 2 mm. In polymerization of samples, a LED unit was used. The amount of monomers released from the samples kept in 75% ethanol/water solution was measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instrument in the 10th minute, in the 1st hour, and in the 1st, 7th, and 14th days. For statistical analyses, the paired sample t-test, independent sample t-test, and one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test were used. Results: The amount of residual monomers released from all materials increased over time. At the end of the 14th day, the most released monomer from all compomer samples was BisGMA. The total amounts of released monomers from the packable compomers were Gold>A2>blue>pink. The amount of residual monomers released from flowable compomers was higher in blue than in pink.

The goal is to select a limited size subset of vertices (called a seed-set) in a Social Graph, so that upon their activation, a maximum number of vertices of the graph become activated, due to the influence of the vertices on each other. The linear threshold model is one of two classic stochastic propagation models that describe the spread of influence in a network. We present a new approach called MLPR (matrix multiplication, linear programming, randomized rounding) with linear programming used as its core in order to solve the influence maximization problem in the linear threshold model. Experiments on four real data sets have shown the efficiency of the MLPR method in solving the influence maximization problem in the linear threshold model. The spread of the output seed-sets is as large as when the state-of-the-art algorithms are used; however, unlike most of the existing algorithms, the runtime of our method is independent of the seed size and does not increase with it."

It has proven to be an appropriate tool on benchmark problems as well as for real-world processes. A severe shortcoming though is the long computation time that is necessary for model training. Therefore, a different optimization strategy, the adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) method with mini batches is used for the LMSSN and compared to the current Quasi-Newton (QN) optimization method. It is shown on a numerical Hammerstein example and on a well known Wiener-Hammerstein benchmark that the use of ADAM and mini batches does not limit the performance of the LMSSN algorithm and speeds up the nonlinear optimization per investigated split by more than 30 times. The price to be paid, however, is higher parameter variance (less interpretability) and more tedious hyperparameter tuning."

Despite the efforts of organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), to promote health promotion and education programs in schools, rates of overweight and obesity remain very high in our country. The objective of this study was to determine the level of physical activity in Spanish students of 5th and 6th grade of primary education. A total of 1009 students of 10 and 12 years old (M-age = 10.85, DE = 0.79), responded the Inventory of Habitual Physical Activity for Schoolchildren (IAFHE), used as the instrument for data collection. The results show statistically significant differences by gender and out-of-school sports practice (NPOS) (p <.001), physical activity during recess (PADR) (p < .001) and sedentary activities (PSA) (p < .001); by age and PADR as well (p = .001). Boys practice more physical activity than girls in and out of school, but, in both cases, they are below WHO recommendations, which should arouse a reflection on healthy habits promoted through school physical education."

In this article, we introduced the concept of bipolar picture fuzzy sets (BP(c)FSs) by connecting the concepts of B(p)FSs and picture fuzzy sets (P(c)FSs). Firstly, we presented the concept, operational rules, score, and accuracy functions of Bp(c)FSs. Secondly, a distance measure is formulated for the Bp(c)FSs and then implemented for the extension of TOPSIS. Thirdly, a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) model is proposed to handle the uncertain MCDM problems.

They have a negative influence on the environment due to the significant release of nitrogen. Hence, the technology for decreasing the N-release is proposed in this work. Obtaining of complex organo-mineral NPK fertilizers by encapsulating a carbamide granule with a phosphate-potassium shell with humates is the main aim of this work. The main tasks of this shell is slow release of the nitrogen and phosphate nutrients from the granules into the soil following the agrochemical needs of plants and prevention of soil pollution. The powdered components agglomeration of phosphate and potassium fertilizers with a small amount of liquid phase (plasticizer) allows forming a phosphate-containing coating on a carbamide core by means of the semi-dry method. This innovation allows organizing the production of such a product at the average enterprise with less capital investment. Carbamide prills, phosphate-glauconite concentrate, calcium and potassium ballast humate, and Avatar trace-element chelate complex were used in experimental studies. A preliminary assessment of the market prospects for such an innovation shows a high level of market attractiveness for all market participants: producers, consumers, and society."

The data obtained inferred that addition of these ceramic reinforcements was naturally enhanced the mechanical and creep properties. Strength due to elongation was observed as high as 111.41 N/mm2 at 120 degrees C when compared to unalloyed aluminium alloy. The load tests analysis reveals that the increase in reinforcement wt% of TaC and Ti combinations leads to increase in resistance for deformation failure and the composite is able to with stand 500 kg load at 120 degrees C. The results of the creep tests shows that the ability of the material to with stand an higher cycle time of more than 30,000 seconds when the strain value is 0.02 wt% of reinforcement are 0.5% of TaC, 6% of Si3N4, and 1% of Ti."
